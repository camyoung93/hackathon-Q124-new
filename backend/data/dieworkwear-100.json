For years, I wrote spring style guides for various publications, including [Put This On](https://putthison.com/)\n, but as menswear has become balkanized into tiny little communities, I've found it better to simply talk about what I'm excited to wear in the new season. These \"Excited to Wear\" posts aren't meant to be prescriptive—find whatever works for you—but perhaps you will find some inspiration here. Here are ten things I'm excited to wear this spring, along with some miscellanea, including a Spotify playlist at the end to go along with the photos. \n\n**Hey, Nice Pants!**\n\nFive years ago, [John Mayer presented his \"theory on pants\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZpahLzfLh4)\n in a dimly lit room while playing [Qari's \"Pants from Japan\" in the background.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wR1QBcmO6c)\n The gist: while pants are often neglected and considered to play second fiddle to jackets, they’re actually important cultural markers. From the bellbottoms of the 1970s to the baggy jeans of the 1990s to the bone-hugging slim-fits of the early aughts, how we cover our lower limbs reflects the spirit of the times. In this sense, Mayer feels we should respect the power of pantaloons and dress from the bottom up. “I’m saying we pick our pants first,” he explained, “and we pick our pants wisely. By making better decisions in pants—and making pant decisions first—we send the circulation of good taste through the rest of our body. The pants we choose will affect what shoes we wear and, systematically, what we wear on top. Good pants make good outfits.”\n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2024/03/29/excited-to-wear-this-spring-5/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BK216_RD6052_d4-copy.jpg)\n\nYou used to have to muscle your way into stores and stand in long lines to take advantage of Black Friday promotions. Nowadays, everything is online, so you can shop from the comfort of your own home. The difficulty, of course, is that you're then swamped with possibilities, making it impossible to know what to buy. To make the landscape a little easier to navigate, I round up some of my favorite Black Friday promotions every year and post them here, along with a selection of notable picks at each store. These guides are designed to cover almost every budget—from relatively affordable basics to designer items—so there's something for everyone. Here's this year's list organized by increasing order of price with a smattering of miscellanea at the end. \n\n**J. CREW: 50% OFF EVERYTHING; NO CODE NEEDED**\n\nIn 2020, when [J. Crew](https://rstyle.me/+K6Rud1ClQLaX99THrcYLNA)\n filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, I wrote an op-ed for [_The Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/06/requiem-gingham-shirt/)\n about how this preppy brand plays an important role in the menswear market. For many guys, J. Crew is their entry point into building a better wardrobe. The company's prices are relatively affordable, and the designs are fairly classic. The company sells things such as chambray work shirts, field jackets, and flat-front chinos—things that look good on almost everyone. However, the departures of Jenna Lyons and Frank Muytjens in 2017 casted a shadow of uncertainty. Speculation surfaced about plans to transform J. Crew into a version of The Gap, potentially distributed through Amazon. So it was a relief when the company ousted the old management and design team, replacing them with Brendon Babenzien, the new Creative Director, who has steered the company clear of such a fate, injecting renewed vitality into this iconic label.\n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/11/24/a-dozen-great-black-friday-sales/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/F1_6GXpakAESuv9.jpeg)\n\nFor the past few years, at the start of every season, I've made it a tradition to publish a post about things I'm excited to wear. These posts are a deliberate shift away from the conventional notion of \"wardrobe essentials,\" a concept that has, in many ways, lost its relevance as people lead different lifestyles. They also allow me to just talk about things I'm excited about. I think that emotional connection—rather than a coldly calculated and rational approach about supposed \"essentials\"—is a much better way to build a wardrobe, as it makes you [think about what you'll love wearing ten years from now](https://dieworkwear.com/2020/08/01/on-emotional-durability/)\n. I've been encouraged by readers who tell me they find these posts useful in helping them build a wardrobe. So here are ten things I'm excited to break out this season, along with a [Spotify playlist at the end](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0zKMF39t9UKhyGNZPDWFFJ?si=9376f401555b4d83)\n that will hopefully set the mood.\n\n**THE POLO COAT**\n\nLike many things, the game of polo is an international phenomenon with cultural origins now long forgotten. The modern version of the game was first played in Manipur, India, where locals called the fist-sized wooden ball _pulu_, a Tibetic term later anglicized to polo. In the mid-19th century, British cavalry officers picked up the sport in India, imported it to England, and then spread it around the world during the height of empire. It’s through this intoxicating mix of sport and nobility that polo has become such fertile ground for menswear. The game has given us the [button-down collar](https://rstyle.me/+dJXEG4uyL_h6jB0yEAwr_g)\n, [jodhpur](https://www.carminashoemaker.com/jodhpur-boots)\n and [chukka boots](https://www.carminashoemaker.com/chukka-desert-boots)\n, [Jaeger-LeCoultre’s Reverso](https://rstyle.me/+eOQ8rDeCHf2gyfkSA-HP9w)\n, and the [most recognizable menswear logo](https://rstyle.me/+oiIJrQHI02aNcpR-sPPnDw)\n. It has also given us the polo coat—the most American of dress outerwear styles.\n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/10/16/excited-to-wear-this-fall-3/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/A2_1.jpeg)\n\nI envy people who aren't interested in clothes. Just the sight of a chunky cream sweater or camp collar shirt is enough to send me into a daydreaming tailspin, where I waste hours of my day poring over online images and reading about the product's construction. Then I imagine the new and exciting life I would lead if I only had that outfit, temporarily forgetting that I'm actually sitting on my couch with my laptop, cat, and Pendleton blanket on my lap, having not moved for hours and with no intention of doing so. I recently found myself doing this, as many of the best online stores are having their end-of-season promotions, each product page ripe with the hope of possibility—the opportunity to dress up for a friendly lunch, a celebratory dinner, or a walk to the market to buy flowers for one's self. So here is a roundup of some of the sales I've been admiring online, peppered with ideas of when and where you can wear such items. \n\n**SSENSE: UP TO 60% OFF; NO CODE**\n\nMaybe it's because I recently watched the [Lemaire SS24 show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOejSO1irzA&ab_channel=FFChannel)\n, but I've been once again daydreaming about the artsy, cultivated life I assume I would live if I just owned a few more pieces from this French designer. Lemaire's clothes fit loose, giving you comfort and room to hide an aging dad bod, but they're rendered in fabrics and details that allow you to pretend you're a sophisticated Belgian artist excited about the [coming relaunch of the beloved book-lit mag](https://www.bookforum.com/culture/the-magazine-relaunches-today-in-partnership-with-the-nation-25191) [_Bookforum_](https://www.bookforum.com/culture/the-magazine-relaunches-today-in-partnership-with-the-nation-25191)\n. I really like the [company's summer pants](https://rstyle.me/+4jLO1gXzqmxzL6mc16gIag)\n, which come with [self-belts](https://rstyle.me/+j28Xy6G-agQZQoEA8w9vAQ)\n, [twisted side seams](https://rstyle.me/+mSWV45AnnVJNVPsdPJnUHg)\n, and [topstitching in unusual places](https://rstyle.me/+Dge3MiK3rp90VVq2iMvE2Q)\n. They move and swish when you walk and lend an attractive silhouette to plain summer outfits. [I've been wearing the company's taupe twisted pants](https://rstyle.me/+mSWV45AnnVJNVPsdPJnUHg)\n with a cream-colored, silk camp collar shirt I bought from [The Post Romantic](https://post-romantic.com/)\n last year, modeled after [this Umit Benan design](https://clothbase.com/items/043ed407_umit-benan-b-camp-collar-silk-satin-shirt-neutrals)\n (the shirt isn't on Post Romantic's site, but is available if you just email them). \n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/07/01/the-best-of-this-seasons-sales/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/330849840_1257648081487749_7132128826289956970_n.jpg)\n\nFor the last few years, I've been doing these posts about things I'm excited to wear for the season. They're a way for me to talk about things I'm excited about without getting into the fraught concept of \"wardrobe essentials\" (which feels increasingly less relevant nowadays when people have such different needs and lifestyles). Still, readers have found these posts to be useful as seasonal style guides. Here's this year's \"excited for spring\" post with a bonus soundtrack at the end. You can check previous years' posts for [2018](https://dieworkwear.com/2018/05/16/a-bit-of-inspiration-for-spring/)\n, [2019](https://dieworkwear.com/2019/04/25/excited-to-wear-this-spring-2/)\n ([I also did one for summer](https://dieworkwear.com/2019/06/01/things-im-excited-to-wear-this-summer/)\n), [2021](https://dieworkwear.com/2021/04/02/excited-to-wear-this-spring/)\n, and [2022](https://dieworkwear.com/2022/04/12/excited-to-wear-this-spring-3/)\n. \n\n**CHAMBRAY AND SILKY SHIRTS**\n\nI've always been primarily an oxford cloth button-down guy. I admire the style's place in American clothing history, as well as its casual, rumpled nature and bookish appeal. However, in the last few years, I've also added two other shirt styles to my regular rotation: snap-button Western shirts, mostly those rendered in denim or needlecord, and silky shirts made from slippery materials such as rayon, Tencel, and actual silk. \n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/06/01/excited-to-wear-this-spring-4/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/L1007796-e1681709802929.jpg)\n\nIn the mid-2000s, I used to take the bus to [Kinokuniya](https://usa.kinokuniya.com/)\n, an Asian bookstore in San Francisco that sold Japanese magazines like _Men's Precious_, _Men's Ex_, and, of course, the famous _Free & Easy_. Non-English publications, then as now, covered classic menswear better than their English counterparts. While American magazines like [_GQ_](https://www.gq.com/)\n and [_Esquire_](https://www.esquire.com/)\n featured articles on Thom Browne and Tom Ford, Japanese publications discussed the differences between English and Italian tailoring, Alden's many lasts, and specialty retailers like [The Andover Shop](https://www.theandovershop.com/)\n. The issue, of course, was that the writing was in Japanese, making it unintelligible to anyone who did not know the language. Aside from English brand names, there were only a few amusing English phrases, such as RUGGED MAN and DAD STYLE (terms for workwear and trad, respectively). Despite my misgivings about spending $25 on a magazine I couldn't read, no one else did this kind of print coverage. The photos alone were an education.\n\nLast summer, I was delighted to learn that Eisuke Yamashita, a former _Men's Precious_ editor, now runs his own website, [Mon Oncle](https://www.mononcle.jp/)\n (French for \"my uncle\"). His site features profiles on menswear legends such as [Luciano Barbera](https://www.mononcle.jp/column/interview/7470/)\n, celebrities such as [Juzo Itami](https://www.mononcle.jp/feature/itami/)\n, and artisans outside the menswear space, such as woodworker [Takafumi Mochizuki](https://www.mononcle.jp/column/mei-hin-jun-rei/7580/)\n. I was also pleased to see a [multi-part series on Yukio Akamine,](https://www.mononcle.jp/column/classic/36/)\n whom I regard as [the most stylish man alive](https://dieworkwear.com/2019/04/20/the-most-stylish-man-alive/)\n. Akamine has a long history in the Japanese menswear scene. He's introduced generations of Japanese men to classic style and consulted for brands such as United Arrows. Nowadays, he runs a made-to-measure tailoring company called Akamine Royal Line and appears on [Japanese shows to discuss menswear](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yukio+akamine)\n.\n\nIn his Mon Oncle interviews, Akamine shares some charming observations and advice. He encourages people to wear jackets that are full enough to allow for comfortable layering (\"It doesn't make sense if you can't wear a sweater underneath your jacket\") and recommends using fountain pens on a regular basis (\"Write letters and take notes. Dozens of years later, they will be a memory for the next generation.\"). Akamine also emphasizes the importance of good manners (\"Don't arrive at someone's home empty-handed. Purchase something that you enjoyed eating. Take it out of the bag, hold it with both hands and say, 'Please enjoy this.' Or wrap it in a furoshiki.\"). Regarding style, he says, \"You don't have to read fashion magazines. Open the window and look outside when you wake up in the morning. A man who can cook rice is a hundred times cooler.\"\n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/04/19/living-legend-an-interview-with-yukio-akamine/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/68825262_2361668890740178_4021842934397061242_n.jpg)\n\nI was having dinner with [Nicholas Templeman](https://www.instagram.com/nicholastemplemanltd/)\n a few years ago at [Besharam](https://besharamrestaurant.com/)\n, a small Indian restaurant located on the outskirts of San Francisco. Over spicy vegetarian curries and delicate semolina puffs, we discussed how the British shoemaking trade has changed over the years. I told him I'd recently spoken with [Daniel Wegan](https://www.instagram.com/catellashoemaker/)\n and [Emiko Matsuda](https://www.instagram.com/emiko.matsuda/?hl=en)\n, two bespoke shoemakers who, like him, left prestigious West End firms to launch their own shoemaking businesses. Wegan and Matsuda's operations are modest, with no advertising budgets, celebrity endorsements, or visible shopfronts. When I asked how customers typically find them, they said, \"Instagram.\" \"That was a big part of why I left [John Lobb](https://www.johnlobb1849.com/)\n when I did,\" Templeman told me. \"At the time, some independent makers in Japan made good use of social media, but not many people in the UK. Even the big shops were barely visible online. With the rise of social media sites like Instagram, I felt this was a good time to become independent.\"\n\nIn the last twenty years, the British bespoke trade has changed dramatically along two fronts: skyrocketing rents and the loss of skilled labor have made it more difficult for larger firms to earn profits and maintain quality. Simultaneously, the internet has created a more informed consumer. These customers, who can be described as \"shoe mad\" enthusiasts, scour blogs and forums for niche details about shoemaking that few people know or care about. Like Athenian philosophers or [Tibetan monks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9d-uOWJAYU)\n, they use the dialectical process to arrive at truths about handwelting and Goodyear welting, Celastic and leather stiffeners, and the specialized construction techniques that go into the uppers and soles of shoes, such as split-and-lift sewing and fiddleback finishings. For men who have succumbed to the allure of craft, celebrity endorsements and shallow, romantic accounts of the bespoke process are not enough. They want to know the intricate, technical details of shoemaking.\n\nThese changes have impacted the British bespoke trade in some crucial ways. In the mid-19th century, [_Punch_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(magazine))\n co-founder Henry Mayhew published a [seminal study on London's laboring classes](https://rstyle.me/+cp-GhnjTzv1rN4VjbePGVw)\n. He estimated the city had 28,574 shoemakers (or \"bootmakers\" if you prefer the Queen's English) in the 1840s, making it the third most popular occupation. By the end of the century, improvements in ready-made footwear dramatically shrank this number to around 3,000, consolidating many workers into a handful of large firms. Among these businesses were gilded names such as John Lobb, Peal & Company, and Henry Maxwell, who built reputations by making shoes for presidents and pioneers, authors and actors, titans of industry, and other members of the ruling class. They also reaped the benefits of a fawning press. After reading enough breathless prose, wealthy men convinced themselves that spending thousands on shoes \"would itself be an act of poetry,\" as my friend [Réginald-Jérôme de Mans](https://rstyle.me/+n9olyhs_ek0nnqWbBxMOcg)\n put it. \n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/04/06/sole-survivors-how-the-internet-is-saving-bespoke-shoemaking-pt-2/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/106492821_271725337416306_4945592073309999211_n.jpg)\n\nWhen it comes to menswear history, it can be challenging to separate fact from fiction. The two are often intertwined in vanity books and marketing pamphlets, and these stories persist because they help companies sell clothes. The best accounts are rooted in primary sources, such as newspaper articles, archival records, or oral histories from reliable voices. Housed within the four brick walls of the [London Metropolitan Archives](https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/history-and-heritage/london-metropolitan-archives)\n, a public research center specializing in the history of London, are the dusty archival order books once owned by Peal & Company.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Peal & Co. was the largest bespoke shoemaking operation in the world. Their salespeople traveled to various continents to take orders from kings, queens, captains of industry, authors and actors, poets and pioneers, and the otherwise well-heeled. Upon meeting each client, a Peal salesperson would crack open a large leather-bound ledger—charmingly known as a Feet Book to people within the company—and trace an outline of the client's feet on the two blank pages. They would then write the person's name and any necessary notes about the order.\n\nWhile flipping through Peal's Feet Books, you can see storied names from the 19th and 20th centuries: Henry Ford, Condé Nast, Anthony Eden, John F. Kennedy, Barry Goldwater, Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Fred Astaire, and Gary Cooper, among the many. Since Peal's sales associates typically recorded these names in full, there's no doubt who ordered what. But buried on page 142 of one of the earliest books is a [mysterious entry for \"Mr. Marx of Berlin.\"](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/abcccbd8-9eb3-435d-b1c2-45bfde20ec01)\n It's estimated that this record was made sometime in the 1870s, which matches when Karl Marx lived in London. A notation on the order says the finished shoes should be delivered to Dr. W.

But as I do every year, I'm also highlighting some special sales from that list here. Perhaps most notable is the blowout over at [LuxeSwap](https://rstyle.me/+FQoyO61MICcse1NEf5OxjA)\n. I didn't include it in this list below because it's not technically a sale. But friend and menswear writer extraordinaire Bruce Boyer is clearing out some things from his wardrobe, and these items are up for auction on eBay. This is not only an opportunity to own something from one of the great menswear writers of our time, but also a chance to own some incredible menswear that may not be available elsewhere. Bruce uses world-class bespoke tailors such as Liverano & Liverano, Cifonelli, and A. Caraceni (the third of which also made for Gianni Agnelli). I handled some of the tailoring, and the workmanship is the best I've seen anywhere. The suits and sport coats fit between a size 38S and 40S, depending on the house style (I found the Liverano to fit slimmer than the A. Caraceni, the second of which has that Golden Age drape). There are also some handsome shoes from labels such as GJ Cleverley, Edward Green, and Stefano Bemer, sweaters from O'Connell's, and accessories from Drake's. [You can find the entire collection by searching for the \"Bruce Boyer Collection.\"](https://rstyle.me/+MekKDLkJOda3KAlWRgli7Q)\n Now to the other Black Friday deals:\n\n**Canoe Club: 30% Off; Code BF22**\n\n[Canoe Club](https://shopcanoeclub.com/)\n represents a new approach to casualwear, where stores aren't just carrying things with a singular point of view, but reflect the eclectic taste of their customers. Twenty or thirty years ago, most casualwear stores specialized in a \"look\"—the minimalism of Helmut Lang, the ruggedness of Levis, or the smart-casual looks of Loro Piana. But as more men have become comfortable dabbling in different aesthetics, and building wardrobes where rare Nikes sit comfortably alongside shell cordovan Aldens, stores such as Canoe Club have gained a lot of ground. \n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2022/11/26/more-black-friday-sales/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-17.jpeg)\n\nFor the past few years, I've been doing these posts every season where I talk about what I'm excited to wear for spring/summer and fall/winter. I usually do these at the beginning of the season. This one comes a little late, but on the upside, I get to talk about some new things I've purchased and have been wearing. There are also more links to in-season options. \n\n**Flamborough Marine Guernsey**\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis once said he hates to be \"dressed.\" By which he means, \"dressed by others.\" He rejects the conventional photoshoot routine as an artifice—photographers and stylists carefully dress their subjects in clothes borrowed from fashion labels, often those advertising on the pages next to the celebrity being featured. [So when DDL was photographed for the cover of](https://www.wmagazine.com/story/exclusive-daniel-day-lewis-giving-up-acting-phantom-thread) [_W Magazine_](https://www.wmagazine.com/story/exclusive-daniel-day-lewis-giving-up-acting-phantom-thread)\n [a few years ago,](https://www.wmagazine.com/story/exclusive-daniel-day-lewis-giving-up-acting-phantom-thread)\n he brought with him a small duffle full of his own clothes. His wardrobe that day included a thoughtful mix of styles: a bespoke three-piece Harris tweed suit made by a tailor in New York City, a blue plaid shirt, a white tee, some rugged jewelry, a pair of slim-straight selvedge jeans, a striped Breton pullover, and some rugged work boots he designed himself. \"I want to wear soft, comforting, plain things,\" he told the interviewer. When the article was published, a small line was printed below each photograph, taking the place where brand names would usually appear.

For years, I wrote spring style guides for various publications, including [Put This On](https://putthison.com/)\n, but as menswear has become balkanized into tiny little communities, I've found it better to simply talk about what I'm excited to wear in the new season. These \"Excited to Wear\" posts aren't meant to be prescriptive—find whatever works for you—but perhaps you will find some inspiration here. Here are ten things I'm excited to wear this spring, along with some miscellanea, including a Spotify playlist at the end to go along with the photos. \n\n**Hey, Nice Pants!**\n\nFive years ago, [John Mayer presented his \"theory on pants\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZpahLzfLh4)\n in a dimly lit room while playing [Qari's \"Pants from Japan\" in the background.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wR1QBcmO6c)\n The gist: while pants are often neglected and considered to play second fiddle to jackets, they’re actually important cultural markers. From the bellbottoms of the 1970s to the baggy jeans of the 1990s to the bone-hugging slim-fits of the early aughts, how we cover our lower limbs reflects the spirit of the times. In this sense, Mayer feels we should respect the power of pantaloons and dress from the bottom up. “I’m saying we pick our pants first,” he explained, “and we pick our pants wisely. By making better decisions in pants—and making pant decisions first—we send the circulation of good taste through the rest of our body. The pants we choose will affect what shoes we wear and, systematically, what we wear on top. Good pants make good outfits.”\n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2024/03/29/excited-to-wear-this-spring-5/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BK216_RD6052_d4-copy.jpg)\n\nYou used to have to muscle your way into stores and stand in long lines to take advantage of Black Friday promotions. Nowadays, everything is online, so you can shop from the comfort of your own home. The difficulty, of course, is that you're then swamped with possibilities, making it impossible to know what to buy. To make the landscape a little easier to navigate, I round up some of my favorite Black Friday promotions every year and post them here, along with a selection of notable picks at each store. These guides are designed to cover almost every budget—from relatively affordable basics to designer items—so there's something for everyone. Here's this year's list organized by increasing order of price with a smattering of miscellanea at the end. \n\n**J. CREW: 50% OFF EVERYTHING; NO CODE NEEDED**\n\nIn 2020, when [J. Crew](https://rstyle.me/+K6Rud1ClQLaX99THrcYLNA)\n filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, I wrote an op-ed for [_The Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/06/requiem-gingham-shirt/)\n about how this preppy brand plays an important role in the menswear market. For many guys, J. Crew is their entry point into building a better wardrobe. The company's prices are relatively affordable, and the designs are fairly classic. The company sells things such as chambray work shirts, field jackets, and flat-front chinos—things that look good on almost everyone. However, the departures of Jenna Lyons and Frank Muytjens in 2017 casted a shadow of uncertainty. Speculation surfaced about plans to transform J. Crew into a version of The Gap, potentially distributed through Amazon. So it was a relief when the company ousted the old management and design team, replacing them with Brendon Babenzien, the new Creative Director, who has steered the company clear of such a fate, injecting renewed vitality into this iconic label.\n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/11/24/a-dozen-great-black-friday-sales/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/F1_6GXpakAESuv9.jpeg)\n\nFor the past few years, at the start of every season, I've made it a tradition to publish a post about things I'm excited to wear. These posts are a deliberate shift away from the conventional notion of \"wardrobe essentials,\" a concept that has, in many ways, lost its relevance as people lead different lifestyles. They also allow me to just talk about things I'm excited about. I think that emotional connection—rather than a coldly calculated and rational approach about supposed \"essentials\"—is a much better way to build a wardrobe, as it makes you [think about what you'll love wearing ten years from now](https://dieworkwear.com/2020/08/01/on-emotional-durability/)\n. I've been encouraged by readers who tell me they find these posts useful in helping them build a wardrobe. So here are ten things I'm excited to break out this season, along with a [Spotify playlist at the end](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0zKMF39t9UKhyGNZPDWFFJ?si=9376f401555b4d83)\n that will hopefully set the mood.\n\n**THE POLO COAT**\n\nLike many things, the game of polo is an international phenomenon with cultural origins now long forgotten. The modern version of the game was first played in Manipur, India, where locals called the fist-sized wooden ball _pulu_, a Tibetic term later anglicized to polo. In the mid-19th century, British cavalry officers picked up the sport in India, imported it to England, and then spread it around the world during the height of empire. It’s through this intoxicating mix of sport and nobility that polo has become such fertile ground for menswear. The game has given us the [button-down collar](https://rstyle.me/+dJXEG4uyL_h6jB0yEAwr_g)\n, [jodhpur](https://www.carminashoemaker.com/jodhpur-boots)\n and [chukka boots](https://www.carminashoemaker.com/chukka-desert-boots)\n, [Jaeger-LeCoultre’s Reverso](https://rstyle.me/+eOQ8rDeCHf2gyfkSA-HP9w)\n, and the [most recognizable menswear logo](https://rstyle.me/+oiIJrQHI02aNcpR-sPPnDw)\n. It has also given us the polo coat—the most American of dress outerwear styles.\n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/10/16/excited-to-wear-this-fall-3/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/A2_1.jpeg)\n\nI envy people who aren't interested in clothes. Just the sight of a chunky cream sweater or camp collar shirt is enough to send me into a daydreaming tailspin, where I waste hours of my day poring over online images and reading about the product's construction. Then I imagine the new and exciting life I would lead if I only had that outfit, temporarily forgetting that I'm actually sitting on my couch with my laptop, cat, and Pendleton blanket on my lap, having not moved for hours and with no intention of doing so. I recently found myself doing this, as many of the best online stores are having their end-of-season promotions, each product page ripe with the hope of possibility—the opportunity to dress up for a friendly lunch, a celebratory dinner, or a walk to the market to buy flowers for one's self. So here is a roundup of some of the sales I've been admiring online, peppered with ideas of when and where you can wear such items. \n\n**SSENSE: UP TO 60% OFF; NO CODE**\n\nMaybe it's because I recently watched the [Lemaire SS24 show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOejSO1irzA&ab_channel=FFChannel)\n, but I've been once again daydreaming about the artsy, cultivated life I assume I would live if I just owned a few more pieces from this French designer. Lemaire's clothes fit loose, giving you comfort and room to hide an aging dad bod, but they're rendered in fabrics and details that allow you to pretend you're a sophisticated Belgian artist excited about the [coming relaunch of the beloved book-lit mag](https://www.bookforum.com/culture/the-magazine-relaunches-today-in-partnership-with-the-nation-25191) [_Bookforum_](https://www.bookforum.com/culture/the-magazine-relaunches-today-in-partnership-with-the-nation-25191)\n. I really like the [company's summer pants](https://rstyle.me/+4jLO1gXzqmxzL6mc16gIag)\n, which come with [self-belts](https://rstyle.me/+j28Xy6G-agQZQoEA8w9vAQ)\n, [twisted side seams](https://rstyle.me/+mSWV45AnnVJNVPsdPJnUHg)\n, and [topstitching in unusual places](https://rstyle.me/+Dge3MiK3rp90VVq2iMvE2Q)\n. They move and swish when you walk and lend an attractive silhouette to plain summer outfits. [I've been wearing the company's taupe twisted pants](https://rstyle.me/+mSWV45AnnVJNVPsdPJnUHg)\n with a cream-colored, silk camp collar shirt I bought from [The Post Romantic](https://post-romantic.com/)\n last year, modeled after [this Umit Benan design](https://clothbase.com/items/043ed407_umit-benan-b-camp-collar-silk-satin-shirt-neutrals)\n (the shirt isn't on Post Romantic's site, but is available if you just email them). \n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/07/01/the-best-of-this-seasons-sales/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/330849840_1257648081487749_7132128826289956970_n.jpg)\n\nFor the last few years, I've been doing these posts about things I'm excited to wear for the season. They're a way for me to talk about things I'm excited about without getting into the fraught concept of \"wardrobe essentials\" (which feels increasingly less relevant nowadays when people have such different needs and lifestyles). Still, readers have found these posts to be useful as seasonal style guides. Here's this year's \"excited for spring\" post with a bonus soundtrack at the end. You can check previous years' posts for [2018](https://dieworkwear.com/2018/05/16/a-bit-of-inspiration-for-spring/)\n, [2019](https://dieworkwear.com/2019/04/25/excited-to-wear-this-spring-2/)\n ([I also did one for summer](https://dieworkwear.com/2019/06/01/things-im-excited-to-wear-this-summer/)\n), [2021](https://dieworkwear.com/2021/04/02/excited-to-wear-this-spring/)\n, and [2022](https://dieworkwear.com/2022/04/12/excited-to-wear-this-spring-3/)\n. \n\n**CHAMBRAY AND SILKY SHIRTS**\n\nI've always been primarily an oxford cloth button-down guy. I admire the style's place in American clothing history, as well as its casual, rumpled nature and bookish appeal. However, in the last few years, I've also added two other shirt styles to my regular rotation: snap-button Western shirts, mostly those rendered in denim or needlecord, and silky shirts made from slippery materials such as rayon, Tencel, and actual silk. \n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/06/01/excited-to-wear-this-spring-4/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/L1007796-e1681709802929.jpg)\n\nIn the mid-2000s, I used to take the bus to [Kinokuniya](https://usa.kinokuniya.com/)\n, an Asian bookstore in San Francisco that sold Japanese magazines like _Men's Precious_, _Men's Ex_, and, of course, the famous _Free & Easy_. Non-English publications, then as now, covered classic menswear better than their English counterparts. While American magazines like [_GQ_](https://www.gq.com/)\n and [_Esquire_](https://www.esquire.com/)\n featured articles on Thom Browne and Tom Ford, Japanese publications discussed the differences between English and Italian tailoring, Alden's many lasts, and specialty retailers like [The Andover Shop](https://www.theandovershop.com/)\n. The issue, of course, was that the writing was in Japanese, making it unintelligible to anyone who did not know the language. Aside from English brand names, there were only a few amusing English phrases, such as RUGGED MAN and DAD STYLE (terms for workwear and trad, respectively). Despite my misgivings about spending $25 on a magazine I couldn't read, no one else did this kind of print coverage. The photos alone were an education.\n\nLast summer, I was delighted to learn that Eisuke Yamashita, a former _Men's Precious_ editor, now runs his own website, [Mon Oncle](https://www.mononcle.jp/)\n (French for \"my uncle\"). His site features profiles on menswear legends such as [Luciano Barbera](https://www.mononcle.jp/column/interview/7470/)\n, celebrities such as [Juzo Itami](https://www.mononcle.jp/feature/itami/)\n, and artisans outside the menswear space, such as woodworker [Takafumi Mochizuki](https://www.mononcle.jp/column/mei-hin-jun-rei/7580/)\n. I was also pleased to see a [multi-part series on Yukio Akamine,](https://www.mononcle.jp/column/classic/36/)\n whom I regard as [the most stylish man alive](https://dieworkwear.com/2019/04/20/the-most-stylish-man-alive/)\n. Akamine has a long history in the Japanese menswear scene. He's introduced generations of Japanese men to classic style and consulted for brands such as United Arrows. Nowadays, he runs a made-to-measure tailoring company called Akamine Royal Line and appears on [Japanese shows to discuss menswear](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yukio+akamine)\n.\n\nIn his Mon Oncle interviews, Akamine shares some charming observations and advice. He encourages people to wear jackets that are full enough to allow for comfortable layering (\"It doesn't make sense if you can't wear a sweater underneath your jacket\") and recommends using fountain pens on a regular basis (\"Write letters and take notes. Dozens of years later, they will be a memory for the next generation.\"). Akamine also emphasizes the importance of good manners (\"Don't arrive at someone's home empty-handed. Purchase something that you enjoyed eating. Take it out of the bag, hold it with both hands and say, 'Please enjoy this.' Or wrap it in a furoshiki.\"). Regarding style, he says, \"You don't have to read fashion magazines. Open the window and look outside when you wake up in the morning. A man who can cook rice is a hundred times cooler.\"\n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/04/19/living-legend-an-interview-with-yukio-akamine/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/68825262_2361668890740178_4021842934397061242_n.jpg)\n\nI was having dinner with [Nicholas Templeman](https://www.instagram.com/nicholastemplemanltd/)\n a few years ago at [Besharam](https://besharamrestaurant.com/)\n, a small Indian restaurant located on the outskirts of San Francisco. Over spicy vegetarian curries and delicate semolina puffs, we discussed how the British shoemaking trade has changed over the years. I told him I'd recently spoken with [Daniel Wegan](https://www.instagram.com/catellashoemaker/)\n and [Emiko Matsuda](https://www.instagram.com/emiko.matsuda/?hl=en)\n, two bespoke shoemakers who, like him, left prestigious West End firms to launch their own shoemaking businesses. Wegan and Matsuda's operations are modest, with no advertising budgets, celebrity endorsements, or visible shopfronts. When I asked how customers typically find them, they said, \"Instagram.\" \"That was a big part of why I left [John Lobb](https://www.johnlobb1849.com/)\n when I did,\" Templeman told me. \"At the time, some independent makers in Japan made good use of social media, but not many people in the UK. Even the big shops were barely visible online. With the rise of social media sites like Instagram, I felt this was a good time to become independent.\"\n\nIn the last twenty years, the British bespoke trade has changed dramatically along two fronts: skyrocketing rents and the loss of skilled labor have made it more difficult for larger firms to earn profits and maintain quality. Simultaneously, the internet has created a more informed consumer. These customers, who can be described as \"shoe mad\" enthusiasts, scour blogs and forums for niche details about shoemaking that few people know or care about. Like Athenian philosophers or [Tibetan monks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9d-uOWJAYU)\n, they use the dialectical process to arrive at truths about handwelting and Goodyear welting, Celastic and leather stiffeners, and the specialized construction techniques that go into the uppers and soles of shoes, such as split-and-lift sewing and fiddleback finishings. For men who have succumbed to the allure of craft, celebrity endorsements and shallow, romantic accounts of the bespoke process are not enough. They want to know the intricate, technical details of shoemaking.\n\nThese changes have impacted the British bespoke trade in some crucial ways. In the mid-19th century, [_Punch_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(magazine))\n co-founder Henry Mayhew published a [seminal study on London's laboring classes](https://rstyle.me/+cp-GhnjTzv1rN4VjbePGVw)\n. He estimated the city had 28,574 shoemakers (or \"bootmakers\" if you prefer the Queen's English) in the 1840s, making it the third most popular occupation. By the end of the century, improvements in ready-made footwear dramatically shrank this number to around 3,000, consolidating many workers into a handful of large firms. Among these businesses were gilded names such as John Lobb, Peal & Company, and Henry Maxwell, who built reputations by making shoes for presidents and pioneers, authors and actors, titans of industry, and other members of the ruling class. They also reaped the benefits of a fawning press. After reading enough breathless prose, wealthy men convinced themselves that spending thousands on shoes \"would itself be an act of poetry,\" as my friend [Réginald-Jérôme de Mans](https://rstyle.me/+n9olyhs_ek0nnqWbBxMOcg)\n put it. \n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/04/06/sole-survivors-how-the-internet-is-saving-bespoke-shoemaking-pt-2/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/106492821_271725337416306_4945592073309999211_n.jpg)\n\nWhen it comes to menswear history, it can be challenging to separate fact from fiction. The two are often intertwined in vanity books and marketing pamphlets, and these stories persist because they help companies sell clothes. The best accounts are rooted in primary sources, such as newspaper articles, archival records, or oral histories from reliable voices. Housed within the four brick walls of the [London Metropolitan Archives](https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/history-and-heritage/london-metropolitan-archives)\n, a public research center specializing in the history of London, are the dusty archival order books once owned by Peal & Company.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Peal & Co. was the largest bespoke shoemaking operation in the world. Their salespeople traveled to various continents to take orders from kings, queens, captains of industry, authors and actors, poets and pioneers, and the otherwise well-heeled. Upon meeting each client, a Peal salesperson would crack open a large leather-bound ledger—charmingly known as a Feet Book to people within the company—and trace an outline of the client's feet on the two blank pages. They would then write the person's name and any necessary notes about the order.\n\nWhile flipping through Peal's Feet Books, you can see storied names from the 19th and 20th centuries: Henry Ford, Condé Nast, Anthony Eden, John F. Kennedy, Barry Goldwater, Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Fred Astaire, and Gary Cooper, among the many. Since Peal's sales associates typically recorded these names in full, there's no doubt who ordered what. But buried on page 142 of one of the earliest books is a [mysterious entry for \"Mr. Marx of Berlin.\"](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/abcccbd8-9eb3-435d-b1c2-45bfde20ec01)\n It's estimated that this record was made sometime in the 1870s, which matches when Karl Marx lived in London. A notation on the order says the finished shoes should be delivered to Dr. W. Smith in the intellectual Hampstead area, where [Marx was known to ride donkeys and picnic at the time.](https://kmflett.wordpress.com/2021/04/27/marx-engels-on-hampstead-heath/)\n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/02/25/sole-survivors-how-the-internet-is-saving-bespoke-shoemaking-pt-1/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/b0b83c64-3454-4b3b-a6b1-8c45c3101c94.jpeg)\n\n[I rounded up every Black Friday sale for Put This On](https://putthison.com/every-black-friday-sale-worth-seeing-5/)\n and will update the list through Cyber Monday. But as I do every year, I'm also highlighting some special sales from that list here. Perhaps most notable is the blowout over at [LuxeSwap](https://rstyle.me/+FQoyO61MICcse1NEf5OxjA)\n. I didn't include it in this list below because it's not technically a sale. But friend and menswear writer extraordinaire Bruce Boyer is clearing out some things from his wardrobe, and these items are up for auction on eBay. This is not only an opportunity to own something from one of the great menswear writers of our time, but also a chance to own some incredible menswear that may not be available elsewhere. Bruce uses world-class bespoke tailors such as Liverano & Liverano, Cifonelli, and A. Caraceni (the third of which also made for Gianni Agnelli). I handled some of the tailoring, and the workmanship is the best I've seen anywhere. The suits and sport coats fit between a size 38S and 40S, depending on the house style (I found the Liverano to fit slimmer than the A. Caraceni, the second of which has that Golden Age drape). There are also some handsome shoes from labels such as GJ Cleverley, Edward Green, and Stefano Bemer, sweaters from O'Connell's, and accessories from Drake's. [You can find the entire collection by searching for the \"Bruce Boyer Collection.\"](https://rstyle.me/+MekKDLkJOda3KAlWRgli7Q)\n Now to the other Black Friday deals:\n\n**Canoe Club: 30% Off; Code BF22**\n\n[Canoe Club](https://shopcanoeclub.com/)\n represents a new approach to casualwear, where stores aren't just carrying things with a singular point of view, but reflect the eclectic taste of their customers. Twenty or thirty years ago, most casualwear stores specialized in a \"look\"—the minimalism of Helmut Lang, the ruggedness of Levis, or the smart-casual looks of Loro Piana. But as more men have become comfortable dabbling in different aesthetics, and building wardrobes where rare Nikes sit comfortably alongside shell cordovan Aldens, stores such as Canoe Club have gained a lot of ground. \n\n[Keep reading](https://dieworkwear.com/2022/11/26/more-black-friday-sales/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/frankcleggleather3.jpg)](https://www.frankcleggleatherworks.com/?utm_source=dieworkwear&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=fcl)\n\n[![](http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/wp-content/banners/postromantic2.png)](https://post-romantic.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/rave3.jpg)](https://ravefabricare.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/tlbmallorca.jpg)](https://www.tlbmallorca.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/namu2.jpg)](https://www.namu-shop.com/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/carmina2.jpg)](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/nomanwalksalone4.jpg)](https://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/?utm_source=dww&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dww1)\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/banners/spiermackay.jpg)](https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-new-arrivals)\n\n![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-17.jpeg)\n\nFor the past few years, I've been doing these posts every season where I talk about what I'm excited to wear for spring/summer and fall/winter. I usually do these at the beginning of the season. This one comes a little late, but on the upside, I get to talk about some new things I've purchased and have been wearing. There are also more links to in-season options. \n\n**Flamborough Marine Guernsey**\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis once said he hates to be \"dressed.\" By which he means, \"dressed by others.\" He rejects the conventional photoshoot routine as an artifice—photographers and stylists carefully dress their subjects in clothes borrowed from fashion labels, often those advertising on the pages next to the celebrity being featured. [So when DDL was photographed for the cover of](https://www.wmagazine.com/story/exclusive-daniel-day-lewis-giving-up-acting-phantom-thread) [_W Magazine_](https://www.wmagazine.com/story/exclusive-daniel-day-lewis-giving-up-acting-phantom-thread)\n [a few years ago,](https://www.wmagazine.com/story/exclusive-daniel-day-lewis-giving-up-acting-phantom-thread)\n he brought with him a small duffle full of his own clothes. His wardrobe that day included a thoughtful mix of styles: a bespoke three-piece Harris tweed suit made by a tailor in New York City, a blue plaid shirt, a white tee, some rugged jewelry, a pair of slim-straight selvedge jeans, a striped Breton pullover, and some rugged work boots he designed himself. \"I want to wear soft, comforting, plain things,\" he told the interviewer.

While I’m mostly interested in tailored clothing, my eye wanders when it comes to casualwear. I find myself sampling here and there, being drawn to new brands and styles every so often. Here are six newish companies I’ve been looking at this past year.

Lots of smocks, anoraks, and field jackets here, but designed to fit better than the originals and constructed from much more interesting fabrics. The biggest draw for me is the complex layering that can be achieved with some of their liners. Their hood and body liners can be snapped into any of their jackets for a unique and somewhat aggressive look. You can see the effect in the first photo at top of this post. \n\nUnfortunately, one user on StyleForum reports that the Ten C’s fabrics aren’t [as water resistant](http://www.styleforum.net/t/294826/ten-c-the-emperors-new-clothes/180_20#post_6170568)\n as one might wish, which is kind of a bummer given the price point. Still, if you want to learn more, you can check out the company’s [website](http://www.ten-c.it/collection/)\n, where Paul Harvey can be heard describing each piece in detail. You can also find them available at [Oi Polloi](http://www.oipolloi.com/shop/brand/ten-c)\n, [Haven](http://shop.havenshop.ca/collections/ten-c)\n, and [Union](http://store.unionlosangeles.com/collections/ten-c)\n, as well as sometimes on discount at [Yoox](http://bit.ly/1mh3iaF)\n.  \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/12d2c5ea517629b7a4e120bcb56e6565/tumblr_inline_p7lj6qZEHP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb81a8a97ae8dc0dd67fe0458c764a52/tumblr_inline_p7lj6sbPxV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe Munich-based brand **[A Kind of Guise](http://akindofguise.com/)\n** started in 2009 as a student project, where the founders made bags out of leftover leathers for friends and relatives. Since then, they’ve grown into a full menswear line, complete with outerwear, knitwear, and cut-and-sewns. Designs are creative, and every season, there are one or two pieces that I wouldn’t mind owning myself. This past spring, for example, they had a black MA-1 bomber with brass zips that I regretfully missed out on, and for fall, they’re offering some interesting zigzag weave sweaters made from [cream,](http://akindofguise.com/product/shevket-crew-knit-ecru/)\n [navy](http://akindofguise.com/product/shevket-crew-knit-black/)\n, and [red](http://akindofguise.com/product/shevket-crew-knit-red/)\n lambswool. I imagine the sweaters could be useful for layering, perhaps under a heavy peacoat or duffle. The brand is available at [Oi Polloi](http://www.oipolloi.com/shop/brand/a-kind-of-guise)\n, [SOTO Berlin](http://www.sotostore.com/store/brands/a-kind-of-guise)\n, [Yoox](http://bit.ly/1qPKhPC)\n, and the company’s [own webshop](http://akindofguise.com/product-category/mens/)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a0bc0d7aa51f21d9324f4ad6f1e324b/tumblr_inline_p7lj6teUOP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bcb39269865a89a3de8633d37137dfeb/tumblr_inline_p7lj6t3GFz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/92e63e5b8338010b9a189f4cb99b661d/tumblr_inline_p7lj6tSfLH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nOK, I’ve [written](https://dieworkwear.com/post/74286996064/a-post-that-will-please-no-one)\n about **[Chimala](http://chimaladesign.com/)\n** before, but I’m excited enough by the brand to mention them again. Chimala is a Japanese workwear company, with garments that sometimes fit a bit fuller than what’s common these days (I find that refreshing). They also have really unique pre-distressed detailing (_gasp!_), which is often tastefully executed. Unfortunately, distribution in the US is limited. [Unionmade](http://unionmadegoods.com/brands/chimala/)\n and [J. Crew](http://bit.ly/XzGYnj)\n carry a few styles in small quantities, but for anything more, you’ll have to check Japanese stores such as [Shabby & Industrial](http://shabby.jp/style/index.html)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe09279f8bbd99653c75c272c799db58/tumblr_inline_p7lj6ui6wX1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/727584503a3dd93f183216f50d9eb236/tumblr_inline_p7lj6uOdD01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nYes, another workwear brand (have your laugh). **[Frank Leder](http://www.frank-leder.com/)\n** is a German designer who makes clothes that are simple enough to be easily incorporated into any casual wardrobe, but distinct enough to be worthy of mention. Designs draw a lot from workwear and military influences, but also have a certain sense of humor, which prevents them from looking too serious. Supposedly, some of these garments are constructed from “traditional German fabrications,” such as deutschleder or schladminger – although I haven’t the faintest clue what that really means. Stocked at [Neighbour](http://www.shopneighbour.com/collections/frank-leder)\n and [South Willard](http://www.southwillard.com/)\n for those interested. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3cd4dacd8740df13f94eda9f2eac23b6/tumblr_inline_p7lj6uEnkK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/878d5850c678aae9702133ac86665999/tumblr_inline_p7lj6vDiYE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**[Rainmaker](http://www.rainmaker-kyoto.com/)\n** is a new Japanese label by Kouichi Watanabe (formerly of [N4](http://www.nfour.jp/)\n). Admittedly, some of the stuff here is a bit too boyish for me, but I like the knitwear and outerwear. Certain pieces even look like they could be worn with a classic pair of grey flannel trousers and a casual button-up for a relaxed, off-hours look.

On a hot summer day, I can imagine wearing one of her button-up shirts and chinos, along with some of [Barbara Shaum’s sandals](https://dieworkwear.com/post/91859949764/a-sandal-maker)\n, and just relaxing in my backyard.

While I’m mostly interested in tailored clothing, my eye wanders when it comes to casualwear. I find myself sampling here and there, being drawn to new brands and styles every so often. Here are six newish companies I’ve been looking at this past year. Perhaps you’ll find something to like as well. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/928ab715fd3a24cc8bf7e440b609dd99/tumblr_inline_p7lj6pwahC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/efcd57de113440b24774ae8abb06a7c4/tumblr_inline_p7lj6pMuH81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7b037a596846c6b7a0ac795548d7327d/tumblr_inline_p7lj6qMn821qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**[Ten C](http://www.ten-c.it/about/)** is an Italian outerwear company by former Stone Island/ CP Company designers Alessandro Pugetti and Paul Harvey. Lots of smocks, anoraks, and field jackets here, but designed to fit better than the originals and constructed from much more interesting fabrics. The biggest draw for me is the complex layering that can be achieved with some of their liners. Their hood and body liners can be snapped into any of their jackets for a unique and somewhat aggressive look. You can see the effect in the first photo at top of this post. \n\nUnfortunately, one user on StyleForum reports that the Ten C’s fabrics aren’t [as water resistant](http://www.styleforum.net/t/294826/ten-c-the-emperors-new-clothes/180_20#post_6170568)\n as one might wish, which is kind of a bummer given the price point. Still, if you want to learn more, you can check out the company’s [website](http://www.ten-c.it/collection/)\n, where Paul Harvey can be heard describing each piece in detail. You can also find them available at [Oi Polloi](http://www.oipolloi.com/shop/brand/ten-c)\n, [Haven](http://shop.havenshop.ca/collections/ten-c)\n, and [Union](http://store.unionlosangeles.com/collections/ten-c)\n, as well as sometimes on discount at [Yoox](http://bit.ly/1mh3iaF)\n.  \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/12d2c5ea517629b7a4e120bcb56e6565/tumblr_inline_p7lj6qZEHP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb81a8a97ae8dc0dd67fe0458c764a52/tumblr_inline_p7lj6sbPxV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe Munich-based brand **[A Kind of Guise](http://akindofguise.com/)\n** started in 2009 as a student project, where the founders made bags out of leftover leathers for friends and relatives. Since then, they’ve grown into a full menswear line, complete with outerwear, knitwear, and cut-and-sewns. Designs are creative, and every season, there are one or two pieces that I wouldn’t mind owning myself. This past spring, for example, they had a black MA-1 bomber with brass zips that I regretfully missed out on, and for fall, they’re offering some interesting zigzag weave sweaters made from [cream,](http://akindofguise.com/product/shevket-crew-knit-ecru/)\n [navy](http://akindofguise.com/product/shevket-crew-knit-black/)\n, and [red](http://akindofguise.com/product/shevket-crew-knit-red/)\n lambswool. I imagine the sweaters could be useful for layering, perhaps under a heavy peacoat or duffle. The brand is available at [Oi Polloi](http://www.oipolloi.com/shop/brand/a-kind-of-guise)\n, [SOTO Berlin](http://www.sotostore.com/store/brands/a-kind-of-guise)\n, [Yoox](http://bit.ly/1qPKhPC)\n, and the company’s [own webshop](http://akindofguise.com/product-category/mens/)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a0bc0d7aa51f21d9324f4ad6f1e324b/tumblr_inline_p7lj6teUOP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bcb39269865a89a3de8633d37137dfeb/tumblr_inline_p7lj6t3GFz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/92e63e5b8338010b9a189f4cb99b661d/tumblr_inline_p7lj6tSfLH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nOK, I’ve [written](https://dieworkwear.com/post/74286996064/a-post-that-will-please-no-one)\n about **[Chimala](http://chimaladesign.com/)\n** before, but I’m excited enough by the brand to mention them again. Chimala is a Japanese workwear company, with garments that sometimes fit a bit fuller than what’s common these days (I find that refreshing). They also have really unique pre-distressed detailing (_gasp!_), which is often tastefully executed. Unfortunately, distribution in the US is limited. [Unionmade](http://unionmadegoods.com/brands/chimala/)\n and [J. Crew](http://bit.ly/XzGYnj)\n carry a few styles in small quantities, but for anything more, you’ll have to check Japanese stores such as [Shabby & Industrial](http://shabby.jp/style/index.html)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe09279f8bbd99653c75c272c799db58/tumblr_inline_p7lj6ui6wX1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/727584503a3dd93f183216f50d9eb236/tumblr_inline_p7lj6uOdD01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nYes, another workwear brand (have your laugh). **[Frank Leder](http://www.frank-leder.com/)\n** is a German designer who makes clothes that are simple enough to be easily incorporated into any casual wardrobe, but distinct enough to be worthy of mention. Designs draw a lot from workwear and military influences, but also have a certain sense of humor, which prevents them from looking too serious. Supposedly, some of these garments are constructed from “traditional German fabrications,” such as deutschleder or schladminger – although I haven’t the faintest clue what that really means. Stocked at [Neighbour](http://www.shopneighbour.com/collections/frank-leder)\n and [South Willard](http://www.southwillard.com/)\n for those interested. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3cd4dacd8740df13f94eda9f2eac23b6/tumblr_inline_p7lj6uEnkK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/878d5850c678aae9702133ac86665999/tumblr_inline_p7lj6vDiYE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**[Rainmaker](http://www.rainmaker-kyoto.com/)\n** is a new Japanese label by Kouichi Watanabe (formerly of [N4](http://www.nfour.jp/)\n). Admittedly, some of the stuff here is a bit too boyish for me, but I like the knitwear and outerwear. Certain pieces even look like they could be worn with a classic pair of grey flannel trousers and a casual button-up for a relaxed, off-hours look.

Lauren and his wife actually own five residences. There’s an apartment in Manhattan and two houses not far away: a beach house in Montauk, at the tip of Long Island, and an estate in Bedford, which is an hour north of New York City. There are also two more distant getaways: a ranch in Colorado, and a two-house retreat in the posh Round Hill Resort, near Montego Bay in Jamaica. \n\nThrough the years, some of these have been cover features for the design magazine. I’ve pulled out three such issues here, which were published between the years of 2002 and 2007. These won’t be of any interest to anyone who’s not a big Ralph Lauren fan, but for those of us who are – they can be fun glimpses into the life of the man himself. (Spoiler alert: Ralph Lauren’s homes look a lot like Ralph Lauren home catalogs).\n\nA quick breakdown of what you’re looking at: the first residence is a Norman-style manor in Bedford, which was originally constructed in 1919. It’s something between a hunting lodge and a stately home. The mahogany paneled walls are dressed with dark green velvet curtains and decorated with paintings in dense arrangements. The décor feels dramatic, the colors deep, and the rooms seem like they’re caught in a perpetual late afternoon. All over the place, you see references to English life, but in a way that feels co-opted and made American – much like Ralph Lauren’s clothing. \n\nThe second home is the couple’s retreat in Jamaica, which seems to take more color from its surroundings than actually exhibit any itself. The interior has white walls and coverings, straw mats, natural wood structures, and sparse, cobalt blue decorations. The combination feels something like the restrained, elevated style of the 1940s. \n\nFinally, the last is my favorite – Ralph and Ricky Lauren’s ranch in Colorado, which is something like the physical embodiment of RRL. The interiors here are decorated with Art Nouveau-style lamps, stickley wood chairs, and Navajo blankets. I love the look, but can also see how some people might feel uncomfortable with the over-the-top Native American references  (I mean, there are teepees outside for Pete’s sake). One has to wonder how many Native-American-inspired, but made-in-China, RRL shirts one has to sell in order to buy that Native American chief blanket and American flag (both from the 1880s), which decorate the main lodge’s master bedroom.   \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3ade82e942a91b90bcc9345e4e61674/tumblr_inline_peb3snSGWi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f2951633a06ae987f070ca2aecfc72a/tumblr_inline_peb3sonEDV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e7d3e658feee740b8f02d590d8d8ca4/tumblr_inline_peb3soPXs91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a8f8719b9f1b40d290539707b0faf8eb/tumblr_inline_peb3spByEi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f8bbde7d4a86a37624301a1166fc481d/tumblr_inline_peb3spwcaR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/091ea48f9eb0c8a846983dc10f77d58a/tumblr_inline_peb3spKbIL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d793334e22d7aba9bd450c80c28d10cc/tumblr_inline_peb3sqQVfP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/545424dbf93f7a4b081f10bed28eed44/tumblr_inline_peb3sqCfMa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/19d406c1c16e82304ab8bc8df5b818bd/tumblr_inline_peb3srFub01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5303103b790bdcd28c71d0c9402b2a2/tumblr_inline_peb3srI35N1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f43b54f70915061be68866f3e4f5f8a/tumblr_inline_peb3sryBgR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d60e754cdb6ac59387faddbdcfbce29/tumblr_inline_peb3ssS8fa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ea64032d166371667ad8661a88ba3cd/tumblr_inline_peb3ssCfCM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/570ff09897fcebb4c0e3f333d4df8ef5/tumblr_inline_peb3stTkSO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b1f9cb2629b703078a1b6ffb43c4aa73/tumblr_inline_peb3stmewJ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e5d7369975421a2cf9c8eec1fe4e3f7/tumblr_inline_peb3svfVQ81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b07418916b84a0eddc6f873f0fd75f4e/tumblr_inline_peb3sv3h6v1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0d2ba49e1418e7d0101c063b1a943ea/tumblr_inline_peb3swF5mt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5fb479829dc7845e0b9667ed3a3fe29/tumblr_inline_peb3swdIqY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/59f54481c7ecded574751295aaa8213f/tumblr_inline_peb3sxTsAR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ca9ad7647fcb68c082a7ceab5574dc83/tumblr_inline_peb3sxxRfs1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ff7d71b04394c60a136fa725c961191/tumblr_inline_peb3t0gyFR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/02ee207f828b80c1cc13317b3af2e586/tumblr_inline_peb3t2UrQi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb540795251ae06e5ac1257acd9bc8b8/tumblr_inline_peb3t2C0dD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b4f0cde2adf67eb0975979b84aaa00a/tumblr_inline_peb3t3gDcb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a13c3454951e7ec6c4070259590f716b/tumblr_inline_peb3t32NQc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1c53373bee607c145b4e7e9e40732125/tumblr_inline_peb3t3f1qt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eced9431e7109a399b22eadfb3e99ef3/tumblr_inline_peb3t4O0O11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f7c82e98df8d6ef7ac2a9ab475302417/tumblr_inline_peb3t4SrO71qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/70adceb1fc31c25ac9641c5c3468deb4/tumblr_inline_peb3t5Xy141qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ec0076d8eeefef35a4a43b01e13fc23/tumblr_inline_peb3smA8Lp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nEvery once in a while, _Architectural Digest_ does a feature on Ralph Lauren, with the last one being [this online slideshow](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/celebrity-homes/2013/ralph-lauren-bedford-new-york-home-rrl-ranch-colorado-slideshow)\n they put together of some of his homes.

I love the look, but can also see how some people might feel uncomfortable with the over-the-top Native American references  (I mean, there are teepees outside for Pete’s sake). One has to wonder how many Native-American-inspired, but made-in-China, RRL shirts one has to sell in order to buy that Native American chief blanket and American flag (both from the 1880s), which decorate the main lodge’s master bedroom.   \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3ade82e942a91b90bcc9345e4e61674/tumblr_inline_peb3snSGWi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f2951633a06ae987f070ca2aecfc72a/tumblr_inline_peb3sonEDV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e7d3e658feee740b8f02d590d8d8ca4/tumblr_inline_peb3soPXs91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a8f8719b9f1b40d290539707b0faf8eb/tumblr_inline_peb3spByEi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f8bbde7d4a86a37624301a1166fc481d/tumblr_inline_peb3spwcaR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/091ea48f9eb0c8a846983dc10f77d58a/tumblr_inline_peb3spKbIL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d793334e22d7aba9bd450c80c28d10cc/tumblr_inline_peb3sqQVfP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/545424dbf93f7a4b081f10bed28eed44/tumblr_inline_peb3sqCfMa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/19d406c1c16e82304ab8bc8df5b818bd/tumblr_inline_peb3srFub01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5303103b790bdcd28c71d0c9402b2a2/tumblr_inline_peb3srI35N1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f43b54f70915061be68866f3e4f5f8a/tumblr_inline_peb3sryBgR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d60e754cdb6ac59387faddbdcfbce29/tumblr_inline_peb3ssS8fa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ea64032d166371667ad8661a88ba3cd/tumblr_inline_peb3ssCfCM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/570ff09897fcebb4c0e3f333d4df8ef5/tumblr_inline_peb3stTkSO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b1f9cb2629b703078a1b6ffb43c4aa73/tumblr_inline_peb3stmewJ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e5d7369975421a2cf9c8eec1fe4e3f7/tumblr_inline_peb3svfVQ81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b07418916b84a0eddc6f873f0fd75f4e/tumblr_inline_peb3sv3h6v1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0d2ba49e1418e7d0101c063b1a943ea/tumblr_inline_peb3swF5mt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5fb479829dc7845e0b9667ed3a3fe29/tumblr_inline_peb3swdIqY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/59f54481c7ecded574751295aaa8213f/tumblr_inline_peb3sxTsAR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ca9ad7647fcb68c082a7ceab5574dc83/tumblr_inline_peb3sxxRfs1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ff7d71b04394c60a136fa725c961191/tumblr_inline_peb3t0gyFR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/02ee207f828b80c1cc13317b3af2e586/tumblr_inline_peb3t2UrQi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb540795251ae06e5ac1257acd9bc8b8/tumblr_inline_peb3t2C0dD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b4f0cde2adf67eb0975979b84aaa00a/tumblr_inline_peb3t3gDcb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a13c3454951e7ec6c4070259590f716b/tumblr_inline_peb3t32NQc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1c53373bee607c145b4e7e9e40732125/tumblr_inline_peb3t3f1qt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eced9431e7109a399b22eadfb3e99ef3/tumblr_inline_peb3t4O0O11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f7c82e98df8d6ef7ac2a9ab475302417/tumblr_inline_peb3t4SrO71qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/70adceb1fc31c25ac9641c5c3468deb4/tumblr_inline_peb3t5Xy141qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Ralph Lauren and Architectural Digest — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Ralph Lauren and Architectural Digest — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Every once in a while, Architectural Digest does a feature on Ralph Lauren, with the last one being this online slideshow they put together of some of his homes.

Hour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_(photography))\n.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/21b30c7396bca431577def1d6a5e1020/tumblr_inline_pau3e9sInC1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5253d875aa785117a22186f058412f3d/tumblr_inline_pau3e9RrfT1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9edae44652e1a1161a69fe6c8f6a50ed/tumblr_inline_pau3ebmj6f1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c37aa2908d85ae259b214dc4cb21562/tumblr_inline_pau3ebRhCP1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a5df41c11c49b407c1978621c8f3723c/tumblr_inline_pau3eb6nvr1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7f364f55acaf697d5c224169b875f6c2/tumblr_inline_pau3ecZKHs1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f3d30bfd8ee6603e325def65dfd75cd/tumblr_inline_pau3ecwwZ61qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/72770647ab2d569e1d3f2cf494626c06/tumblr_inline_pau3edqJzf1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/961e27b2fe9a8e75624cf7462de8b8fd/tumblr_inline_pau3edfGtq1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/00ccb1603ea63710386a4287e725fbb6/tumblr_inline_pau3edJV1k1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1721fce8dca5077cf5d940548ee6e706/tumblr_inline_pau3eeJx1T1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/08f86887fe0d596174ab15902a1808df/tumblr_inline_pau3eeGK8C1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/369daaf6238020f8d26b8f82a9c3a5a5/tumblr_inline_pau3eebNjV1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/92d4a04bdb081cdd5a3b1eeabea702cb/tumblr_inline_pau3efRPHp1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a55a3c342de8330bf2fc9104229a6e8e/tumblr_inline_pau3efYIgi1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c8063971e6ed64f36468bb3e1362705/tumblr_inline_pau3egX3hF1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/058894dd1659cfd7f887e28181c13005/tumblr_inline_pau3egtYWA1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5aed6174b4fdf8cefeab4d94e9c5ebe0/tumblr_inline_pau3egU2TQ1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab261311c716f0c71abd1ef121116b5f/tumblr_inline_pau3eh390F1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3b2cd2052ab43ef8ff927e544f619d9d/tumblr_inline_pau3ehM69h1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/540eff1b13c02e5d7abe65b4ec9ab5ee/tumblr_inline_pau3eijg1g1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f461992dd478d494823f56bf12e3bb39/tumblr_inline_pau3eiVdCj1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5a5d42c3d4dc6023d15ad36250d7092b/tumblr_inline_pau3eiZ4iu1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/97235d47c4430b9d8f368db1300cf6cb/tumblr_inline_pau3ejvAd21qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d3c14bc9a4cdb956101929ef2bc504e/tumblr_inline_pau3ejAtv11qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/21472e1fa5c6a8b26f8d7364159fe8d8/tumblr_inline_pau3elJTCY1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/37df5f98748444893ce18fc12d531792/tumblr_inline_pau3elZiQc1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/db70f366fdc02fe4a21a90af5be02876/tumblr_inline_pau3emnJJV1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ff7d7b52a22ae8ed4c8b514aff932cc/tumblr_inline_pau3emVUZM1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8518f2143537b0cc5056729ba42a4c0f/tumblr_inline_pau3emnEfH1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9f34b39b6d2553118c0b44fbb578747/tumblr_inline_pau3enmBH51qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/57ca578ecfb50e9ec22438c096270409/tumblr_inline_pau3enWjiv1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2eb9a5e93d226647317260cf530e817c/tumblr_inline_pau3eogBo01qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/97b39cedd17a20b27dd20ba315113ba0/tumblr_inline_pau3eoTbmT1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71da9e7c07f9fe4f38459aec877bb299/tumblr_inline_pau3epDRXk1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/da6dd7425859f45ae4cd14223938a640/tumblr_inline_pau3epJTbt1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8485aaba4944d26bdee4af3cb7ed3739/tumblr_inline_pau3eqNqHX1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd159455a1eec3ae8b4d22e77c12513f/tumblr_inline_pau3eqvP931qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e4438800e80567d095453d577f29dfc/tumblr_inline_pau3eqJZmr1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b2b50499d0a3c39a8258e43ddaaa2af/tumblr_inline_pau3er8z4q1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6daeae1116c5fe0d9fc9e4cf1b0eeabe/tumblr_inline_pau3er2kGU1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3e561d693cfb1558ea5efb8e9ce1bc02/tumblr_inline_pau3esZd841qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8185f34ec2b2a6beaf73d6dd2d64c426/tumblr_inline_pau3esGPWg1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumb

Some notables:\n\n*   **Polo Label Outerwear:** Ralph Lauren’s Polo label has some basic, but well designed, outerwear this coming season. There are some field jackets in [cotton canvas](http://bit.ly/1kWTw2u)\n     and [nylon](http://bit.ly/1kWTQOB)\n    , the first of which is priced surprisingly low. In addition, they’ve brought back their [Cadwell jacket](http://bit.ly/1s2hk3A)\n    , which is an iteration of the lightweight, quilted bombers they do every year, and introduced some bolder designs through these [tartan hunting coats](http://bit.ly/1ncIZMf)\n     and [belted blackwatch oilcloths](http://bit.ly/1s2h7gJ)\n    . I also really like this [B-10 bomber](http://bit.ly/1kWTYOa)\n    , which is a reproduction of the cloth-shelled jackets that the US government supplied to servicemen in the 1940s, for the brief period that leather A-2s were discontinued (which Ralph Lauren has [a repro for as well](http://bit.ly/1kWWioh)\n    ).\n*   **RRL Outerwear:** Not to be missed is RRL’s outerwear, which includes a [roughed-out sueded ranch jacket](http://bit.ly/1kWWGmP)\n     that looks like it was pulled out of some 1920s archive, as well as [a reproduction of early motorcycle jackets](http://bit.ly/1kWWSCt)\n    , which had shawl collars and button fronts. A [fold-down collar moto](http://bit.ly/1ncNsyu)\n     is also available if you want something less old-timey. For more affordable outerwear, there’s a [quilted jacket with a Western-styled yoke](http://bit.ly/1s2ntge)\n     and a [navy deck jacket](http://bit.ly/1kWX8BE)\n     to wear with jeans. I also really like this [indigo discharge print jacket](http://bit.ly/1kWXisE)\n     and [Southwestern](http://bit.ly/1s2o4P0)\n     piece, although I’m not entirely sure I have the flair required to wear the second. \n*   **Knitwear:** For knitwear, Polo has some [basic Shetland sweaters](http://bit.ly/1kWXpoe)\n     with sueded elbow patches (which I imagine can be removed with a seam ripper if they’re not to your liking), a [mock neck cable knit](http://bit.ly/1s2oEw9)\n     that I think would frame the face well, and a [blanket striped shawl collar cardigan](http://bit.ly/1kWXOH4)\n     for those who are brave enough to wear something bright red. For RRL, there are some [basic grey sweatshirts](http://bit.ly/1kWXTL5)\n    , which will be less stout, but much softer, than [Buzz Rickson’s](http://www.benchandloom.com/shop/sweaters/48)\n    . \n*   **Casual Shirts:** Some of the best casual shirts this season are in the workwear category. Notables include [plaid indigo flannels](http://bit.ly/1kWYxIk)\n     and chambrays in both [dark](http://bit.ly/1z4Hh53)\n     and [light](http://bit.ly/1kWYIU8)\n     washes. I also really like this [indigo calico print shirt](http://bit.ly/1s2tkSs)\n    , which End has [better pictures of](http://www.endclothing.com/brands/rrl/rrl-alaska-antique-work-shirt.html)\n    . Ralph Lauren’s Polo label has [a similar piece for a bit less money](http://bit.ly/1s2tSrx)\n    .  \n*   **Shoes:** Nothing really new in footwear, but Ralph Lauren’s best pieces (i.e. their shell cordovan [penny loafers](http://bit.ly/1ncPIFJ)\n    , [tassel loafers](http://bit.ly/1kWYj45)\n    , and [wingtips](http://bit.ly/1tsYJi1)\n    , as well as [RRL engineer boots](http://bit.ly/1ncSzi1)\n    ) have been restocked.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4933ee736d60b5545c19fb56dd8bb03e/tumblr_inline_peb3sm245R1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a1501dab2dc805df6bab5405b82cc52/tumblr_inline_peb3smNk8S1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/745362c71b084aea6c94588206af7992/tumblr_inline_peb3snf30c1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0ecf535520e83184d8a014c1723355b/tumblr_inline_peb3snIKuN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8a42276e8986a98e2b052f7bfd40f28/tumblr_inline_peb3snTjVK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f9fe6c5c5dfae96123cd7041b6093b9/tumblr_inline_peb3spqLXE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/968d11104e7f6b30e1b224e9146ed4eb/tumblr_inline_peb3sp8Wpb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/955fdfd0270b62691e57c5b86bd237d5/tumblr_inline_peb3sqIw7b1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/56d4a08496120f15b9d1171a9d5d3bad/tumblr_inline_peb3sq56m31qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/581d59eef949ef7ce1a9aa0a90e2307c/tumblr_inline_peb3sqrr2w1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/90b17e5b8d5d9705308eea7617800f38/tumblr_inline_peb3sqOqlp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40e284301d9e317a8e8e785a0f7aea9d/tumblr_inline_peb3sreFe21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6db4650fbfad7287d84f5e037944551c/tumblr_inline_peb3srXAtu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5e3393bf4b5723c56d45e0213cfa80e/tumblr_inline_peb3sr1HQ91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bada65771c210bf78e5375a834df2fe5/tumblr_inline_peb3ssyHLh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5af9d977864b009555841bec47660954/tumblr_inline_peb3ssdfME1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fff53c0a88247464f65c6c5552402ef2/tumblr_inline_peb3sszztG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0d45fb08b9968a733483de69a73d6ef/tumblr_inline_peb3stobvJ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a65c2227caaaf6cabd72979742083a75/tumblr_inline_peb3sujNdl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d55807f94d804324b36c5f681c644fd/tumblr_inline_peb3suB4ge1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5333a8519bc946e6c320b650ada6e562/tumblr_inline_peb3swRiFg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e41316cfba8cf59e8f20f9bd13bdc3d1/tumblr_inline_peb3sxE7X01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f18378c310bf579a340e345b929cd21/tumblr_inline_peb3sxn6M91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2dadea4192adbb77b59cc97db53acff1/tumblr_inline_peb3sxEZbW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/deae7f1436b7ba5c3aee6b05ec1a62b1/tumblr_inline_peb3syoJHd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3660cd65e30ce701b5fac3e07ac1b69/tumblr_inline_peb3syFCWL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a2cdcab6e72306a42739a2263de947f/tumblr_inline_peb3syebt61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7c126c89cf7b05683cba7d708c47f473/tumblr_inline_peb3szbSdh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c80eaefc4f77a9cab1784f52ff526c6a/tumblr_inline_peb3smBp5o1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nNothing rare or esoteric today, just a bunch of new Ralph Lauren fall/ winter releases that I think look pretty great.

I also really like this [B-10 bomber](http://bit.ly/1kWTYOa)\n    , which is a reproduction of the cloth-shelled jackets that the US government supplied to servicemen in the 1940s, for the brief period that leather A-2s were discontinued (which Ralph Lauren has [a repro for as well](http://bit.ly/1kWWioh)\n    ).\n*   **RRL Outerwear:** Not to be missed is RRL’s outerwear, which includes a [roughed-out sueded ranch jacket](http://bit.ly/1kWWGmP)\n     that looks like it was pulled out of some 1920s archive, as well as [a reproduction of early motorcycle jackets](http://bit.ly/1kWWSCt)\n    , which had shawl collars and button fronts. A [fold-down collar moto](http://bit.ly/1ncNsyu)\n     is also available if you want something less old-timey. For more affordable outerwear, there’s a [quilted jacket with a Western-styled yoke](http://bit.ly/1s2ntge)\n     and a [navy deck jacket](http://bit.ly/1kWX8BE)\n     to wear with jeans. I also really like this [indigo discharge print jacket](http://bit.ly/1kWXisE)\n     and [Southwestern](http://bit.ly/1s2o4P0)\n     piece, although I’m not entirely sure I have the flair required to wear the second. \n*   **Knitwear:** For knitwear, Polo has some [basic Shetland sweaters](http://bit.ly/1kWXpoe)\n     with sueded elbow patches (which I imagine can be removed with a seam ripper if they’re not to your liking), a [mock neck cable knit](http://bit.ly/1s2oEw9)\n     that I think would frame the face well, and a [blanket striped shawl collar cardigan](http://bit.ly/1kWXOH4)\n     for those who are brave enough to wear something bright red. For RRL, there are some [basic grey sweatshirts](http://bit.ly/1kWXTL5)\n    , which will be less stout, but much softer, than [Buzz Rickson’s](http://www.benchandloom.com/shop/sweaters/48)\n    . \n*   **Casual Shirts:** Some of the best casual shirts this season are in the workwear category. Notables include [plaid indigo flannels](http://bit.ly/1kWYxIk)\n     and chambrays in both [dark](http://bit.ly/1z4Hh53)\n     and [light](http://bit.ly/1kWYIU8)\n     washes. I also really like this [indigo calico print shirt](http://bit.ly/1s2tkSs)\n    , which End has [better pictures of](http://www.endclothing.com/brands/rrl/rrl-alaska-antique-work-shirt.html)\n    . Ralph Lauren’s Polo label has [a similar piece for a bit less money](http://bit.ly/1s2tSrx)\n    .  \n*   **Shoes:** Nothing really new in footwear, but Ralph Lauren’s best pieces (i.e. their shell cordovan [penny loafers](http://bit.ly/1ncPIFJ)\n    , [tassel loafers](http://bit.ly/1kWYj45)\n    , and [wingtips](http://bit.ly/1tsYJi1)\n    , as well as [RRL engineer boots](http://bit.ly/1ncSzi1)\n    ) have been restocked.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4933ee736d60b5545c19fb56dd8bb03e/tumblr_inline_peb3sm245R1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a1501dab2dc805df6bab5405b82cc52/tumblr_inline_peb3smNk8S1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/745362c71b084aea6c94588206af7992/tumblr_inline_peb3snf30c1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0ecf535520e83184d8a014c1723355b/tumblr_inline_peb3snIKuN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8a42276e8986a98e2b052f7bfd40f28/tumblr_inline_peb3snTjVK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f9fe6c5c5dfae96123cd7041b6093b9/tumblr_inline_peb3spqLXE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/968d11104e7f6b30e1b224e9146ed4eb/tumblr_inline_peb3sp8Wpb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/955fdfd0270b62691e57c5b86bd237d5/tumblr_inline_peb3sqIw7b1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/56d4a08496120f15b9d1171a9d5d3bad/tumblr_inline_peb3sq56m31qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/581d59eef949ef7ce1a9aa0a90e2307c/tumblr_inline_peb3sqrr2w1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/90b17e5b8d5d9705308eea7617800f38/tumblr_inline_peb3sqOqlp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40e284301d9e317a8e8e785a0f7aea9d/tumblr_inline_peb3sreFe21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6db4650fbfad7287d84f5e037944551c/tumblr_inline_peb3srXAtu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5e3393bf4b5723c56d45e0213cfa80e/tumblr_inline_peb3sr1HQ91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bada65771c210bf78e5375a834df2fe5/tumblr_inline_peb3ssyHLh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5af9d977864b009555841bec47660954/tumblr_inline_peb3ssdfME1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fff53c0a88247464f65c6c5552402ef2/tumblr_inline_peb3sszztG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0d45fb08b9968a733483de69a73d6ef/tumblr_inline_peb3stobvJ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a65c2227caaaf6cabd72979742083a75/tumblr_inline_peb3sujNdl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d55807f94d804324b36c5f681c644fd/tumblr_inline_peb3suB4ge1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5333a8519bc946e6c320b650ada6e562/tumblr_inline_peb3swRiFg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e41316cfba8cf59e8f20f9bd13bdc3d1/tumblr_inline_peb3sxE7X01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f18378c310bf579a340e345b929cd21/tumblr_inline_peb3sxn6M91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2dadea4192adbb77b59cc97db53acff1/tumblr_inline_peb3sxEZbW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/deae7f1436b7ba5c3aee6b05ec1a62b1/tumblr_inline_peb3syoJHd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3660cd65e30ce701b5fac3e07ac1b69/tumblr_inline_peb3syFCWL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a2cdcab6e72306a42739a2263de947f/tumblr_inline_peb3syebt61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7c126c89cf7b05683cba7d708c47f473/tumblr_inline_peb3szbSdh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"New Ralph Lauren Arrivals — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"New Ralph Lauren Arrivals — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Nothing rare or esoteric today, just a bunch of new Ralph Lauren fall/ winter releases that I think look pretty great.

I might place my order with the form included in their 1982 catalog, just to give someone at the company a surprise. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0426cf17d11522a339e81f537bff87b/tumblr_inline_p827i0bYVc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ab1584b3a165e33d4f99b6863111b01/tumblr_inline_p827i1y02K1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/81a1e599c3864217530dd15447ad70f1/tumblr_inline_p827i1Ki6j1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/162f4a114cf278e3fbcfeddec4140434/tumblr_inline_p827i29KyV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fb60ca865b34bc04591c6bc210d777ed/tumblr_inline_p827i2Q2CH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc2b14a5919358b36c1a409dd3c8b249/tumblr_inline_p827i2bHiP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0496e02469bc92b2f48c100e45d3515/tumblr_inline_p827i34nBF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5f8b8f56aabec9a4de0e45b785dd4530/tumblr_inline_p827i3XuSZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c438e868a1cbcaee799dc8c8385cd20/tumblr_inline_p827i4QPGa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f12bcd5d309b9d0b7ef5f696889c8fe7/tumblr_inline_p827i4L50H1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c85d760cae00d47a10f83bb7080b44c1/tumblr_inline_p827i5kVSI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f655b768fee77fbc816c5edd3c8c693/tumblr_inline_p827i5OuI21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0463bab5e0881ab3d71535fc07e90e85/tumblr_inline_p827i5O5xQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/af0f4ac2c31379d001e3223de2bbd7bf/tumblr_inline_p827i6uQHU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8dd277848319f481ca58f4cbb6aff245/tumblr_inline_p827i6eSAB1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4e035f145a8c0e92b92a6792c9cc85d9/tumblr_inline_p827i6pv2I1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ef3b4bb531d1c963910cbefb445c090/tumblr_inline_p827i7tFXU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/090f0575d6fab08123e90917b2853516/tumblr_inline_p827i7mcSs1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4658797d8393ed356a17e625d8cdc2f3/tumblr_inline_p827i8p9zm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/517b5623c3391c28d35ea8153877d810/tumblr_inline_p827i82yfy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a41839cebb224c4f3cd44d99c2d20039/tumblr_inline_p827i8sd8f1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/16a69a19053612ef1d56dc1a60689ff8/tumblr_inline_p827i9Rviw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/74ee25288c7ccba7f641b164141a7db1/tumblr_inline_p827i9bDhZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5851dab9bb3419658d3c3cd90272ab4/tumblr_inline_p827i9HA5k1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/216181c618c5b30854e783215604020a/tumblr_inline_p827ia3mBZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/861b63cff7d0c273038bfe25fb6ac12f/tumblr_inline_p827iaojVO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0b62f59ecff7776289cceb081356e2da/tumblr_inline_p827ib5kHu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f02d412eec7a3172d65c90e4503598b/tumblr_inline_p827ibIa4j1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Vintage Russell Moccasin Catalogs — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Vintage Russell Moccasin Catalogs — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Before custom shoemaking in the US was mostly bespoke and made-to-orders, there was a small niche of manufacturers who would make shoes based off of the individualized foot tracings that customers would mail in. Russell Moccasin was one such firm.

Many thanks to [NorCal\\_1](http://www.styleforum.net/u/13384/norcal-1)\n for tipping me off to it. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a218c4cf5b08a1073e6b7e80e9d40640/tumblr_inline_p7lw7dSWP21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4058d2291c652b8d1e0344c9d70ccdc5/tumblr_inline_p7lw7e6aTH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff9cb9171831d718f293fdfaa9ff35a0/tumblr_inline_p7lw7e9ijn1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9619f1d64771d487c9bb85e4c8ebb939/tumblr_inline_p7lw7et2jC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/754f24dc861e44e4a40fa7f116d074a4/tumblr_inline_p7lw7fUKDp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/aca57d275e46e20dc7af8f459eeecf0a/tumblr_inline_p7lw7fcjYG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/823687211dfd1eb35ed41ec2b7d1432d/tumblr_inline_p7lw7g4twD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd31da6fada819836852dda0fda2bebf/tumblr_inline_p7lw7gJXkl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/14806122cdc937313f576fe71b40e669/tumblr_inline_p7lw7hewtV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc980942fa2b793d620f305bfcade5ef/tumblr_inline_p7lw7h2SlA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/37d09e51154c30f9400d595481dc76c2/tumblr_inline_p7lw7iVNhl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2e784492eaf7be3e8753ef44220b3778/tumblr_inline_p7lw7jNQ1O1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/822a7839c6ae3803e704fcb7534838d3/tumblr_inline_p7lw7jWHzN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8107f956e9e748bff4b9b4745bd2f34/tumblr_inline_p7lw7kENZ01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/552e6723d5f9eca786db0c6cba5a1092/tumblr_inline_p7lw7kw82e1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6daf9117a0ef0a4ebcf4948b9cf47b6c/tumblr_inline_p7lw7lpt5w1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/393088910ecf960b291a2d91737284c8/tumblr_inline_p7lw7loB4E1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d1ec2daa62241d390db2d43b8d3efbf1/tumblr_inline_p7lw7lJf4c1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ca448dc62fab1e68ce17de3713e71fa4/tumblr_inline_p7lw7m6DD81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d0be01d160140963737f308192bdffda/tumblr_inline_p7lw7meVQz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b992153c3a227a5b4fea22375dc54356/tumblr_inline_p7lw7mvAca1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d89a38602f70cd4382a6c919b1e6e7d4/tumblr_inline_p7lw7nxcvr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce2c52b0e0be673d246827b3eef3287b/tumblr_inline_p7lw7oOtor1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f712633f9c880358d5e958d9dd891107/tumblr_inline_p7lw7omO4W1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e50a756953eefa407b0badab8cf95d1f/tumblr_inline_p7lw7p6f1C1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a6814636a0335c4bd2cc86f91fe9c793/tumblr_inline_p7lw7q3Pel1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d11c2455d19a84fee60c82790f1f8918/tumblr_inline_p7lw7qcbrq1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/87ff6c3c3cf19e235553e4b67607bfc3/tumblr_inline_p7lw7r8Zal1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b9af46b80e8aa24ab5df2b6b5dd69ac6/tumblr_inline_p7lw7r4ad41qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d1b6b9e55b6d81a99c5a98af0581e2e/tumblr_inline_p7lw7riS341qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc5e94a46c1282091c7d2404c8a3b181/tumblr_inline_p7lw7sonJa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd1e0e5301be6591f2fc6f1f42fd7bbf/tumblr_inline_p7lw7sKsSp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a1c5bc8bc58106e6d07d8d3d5434aade/tumblr_inline_p7lw7tXzKW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e561b1be72367219eb1dc8a8386f48f/tumblr_inline_p7lw7tRP531qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"The Closest You'll Get to An RL Archive — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"The Closest You'll Get to An RL Archive — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Many brands maintain archives.

Crew’s [Wallace & Barnes sub-line](http://bit.ly/1pIU5IP)\n is worth checking out. The line has been around for a few years now, but has surprisingly attracted little attention from the menswear community. Not totally sure why. The pieces have more of a boutique feel than J. Crew’s mainline, are made from considerably better materials, and are supposedly inspired by the vintage pieces that Frank Muytjens and his team routinely collect for their design archive. All things that make other lines appealing, except that Wallace & Barnes doesn’t come with the same price tags. \n\nTake these two shirts, for example. The first is made from a [heavy and thick cotton canvas](http://bit.ly/1lQ9NqC)\n, and has an interweaving of brown and cream yarns that gives it a unique textured look. The side seams, yoke, and sleeves are all tripled-stitched, and the overall construction has a sturdiness that’s more reminiscent of RRL than J. Crew. The second shirt is an [inky-blue, deep indigo-dyed piece](http://bit.ly/1weniB0)\n, with a white pin dot pattern that has been woven into the fabric (rather than printed on). The subtle variegation in its coloring makes it feel more hand dyed and special – something more like what you’d expect from a niche Japanese label. I picked up both shirts on sale for $35 and $65, respectively. You can hardly drink at a bar in San Francisco these days with that kind of money. \n\nGranted, the designs are not particularly unique, but the fabrications are nice, and the clothes are simple enough to be versatile. This season, Wallace & Barnes has things such as [washed chambray shirts](http://bit.ly/1tFAlgG)\n, which look better than [Uniqlo’s (faux) Pure Blue Japan offering](http://bit.ly/1werkcC)\n, and comes at a cheaper price than [Chimala’s](http://bit.ly/1tFAgd2)\n (you can add your own wear-and-tear for a more authentic look). There’s also some [Japanese selvedge cotton chinos](http://bit.ly/1lRDB6k)\n, which come in a heavier weight cotton than [Left Field’s](http://leftfieldnyc.com/products/khaki-japanese-twill-miner-chino)\n (a brand that I’ve come to really like), and a [grey sweatshirt](http://bit.ly/1wevjG9)\n that’s presumably better than the [company’s mainline](http://bit.ly/1tFAUqI)\n. All things that you can probably pair with whatever casualwear you might have in your closet. \n\nAgain, the key is to buy all this stuff on sale, as J. Crew routinely discounts everything by 25-50%. They won’t come with the “artisanal” story of smaller brands, but you’ll have a story about how you saved money. That can sometimes be a good story as well. \n\n_(Pictured here: [Cotton canvas](http://bit.ly/1lQ9NqC)\n and [indigo pin dot](http://bit.ly/1weniB0)\n shirts by J.

Japan, for example, has a vibrant community of bespoke cordwainers, who are renowned for their sleek styling and shapely lasts. Certain countries in Central Europe also uphold a long Austro-Hungarian tradition, which includes making a unique style known as the Budapester – a brogued derby with high walls, large medallions, and slightly upturned toes.\n\nIn the past few weeks, as fall has been approaching, I’ve been eyeing a few of those Central European makers. They’re not always pretty to look at online, but once you imagine them underneath cavalry twills or corduroys, and paired with a thick and heavy tweed jacket, they suddenly make more sense. They’re country shoes, standing opposite to the slick city oxfords that men wear with business suits, and are great with casualwear (tailored or otherwise).\n\nOne such maker is [Ludwig Reiter](https://www.ludwig-reiter.com)\n – an old, old Viennese firm that has been around for almost 130 years. As the story goes, the company started as a small workshop, but then grew to supply custom-made boots to the Austro-Hungarian Army. Sometime in the early 20th century, the owner’s son, Ludwig Reiter II, spent time traveling between Germany, England, and the United States, working at various footwear factories along the way. When he returned to Vienna, he came with the knowledge of how to make Goodyear welted shoes, so with some retooling, he turned his father’s boutique into a factory. Four generations later, Ludwig Reiter now makes some of the best Goodyear welted shoes in a slightly more “modern” take on classic Austro-Hungarian style.\n\nUnfortunately, their shoes are hard to find outside of Europe. The only two readily available, online stockists I know of are [Manufactum](http://www.manufactum.com/ludwig-reiter-gentlemens-hunting-boots-russia-leather-p1464962/?a=20518)\n and [StyleBop](http://bit.ly/1tLXZZ4)\n, with the second [discounting their remaining inventory](http://bit.ly/1CU9Jey)\n by up to 50% at the end of every season. Personally, I have my heart is set on this season’s [dark brown Budapesters](http://bit.ly/1xLTq3B)\n. They look like a slightly less aggressive version of the region’s most famous style, and possibly an ideal choice to go with this coming season’s flannels and tweeds. \n\n_(Photos via [Ludwig Reiter](https://www.ludwig-reiter.com)\n, [StyleBop](http://bit.ly/1tLXZZ4)\n, [Manufactum](http://www.manufactum.com/ludwig-reiter-gentlemens-hunting-boots-russia-leather-p1464962/?a=20518)\n, [Shopikon](http://www.shopikon.com/s/vienna/ludwig-reiter-1-innere-stadt)\n, and [Ella La Petite Anglaise](http://www.ella-lapetiteanglaise.com/introducing-ludwig-reiter/)\n)_[](https://www.ludwig-reiter.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5218729b9140175369b0fd2690287ad2/tumblr_inline_p8e6vvmGZJ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c8f81eb44016e6f5457013d08223e6d2/tumblr_inline_p8e6vvEDs91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/95e706ae8db40c3e3de7936da2fa3c06/tumblr_inline_p8e6vwdgbt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e24fea5b0f600536fd5f3abf95f391b/tumblr_inline_p8e6vwizAo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b5ebf1e1647df6190449ee99c6e7eec/tumblr_inline_p8e6vw08861qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6045d881238a6ad03e5863c264560a3/tumblr_inline_p8e6vxss1s1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/846812a2257bfc51f5e195cbb392eae1/tumblr_inline_p8e6vxdMq21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/03d99cc3415c0492f94d0d5a524d4d6b/tumblr_inline_p8e6vxMUCS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/86005bbfe80c07d6a74f4f191bce4374/tumblr_inline_p8e6vyjFW91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dbb60a511d75cf5b6e820824b4340bf9/tumblr_inline_p8e6vys9re1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f92680b7a9598806af5fa6e42cad0f96/tumblr_inline_p8e6vyxqyK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f2fead69027567ae2771475b06aec91e/tumblr_inline_p8e6vzOL9I1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8db23ab725517fb076ca91c960af749c/tumblr_inline_p8e6vzYaan1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0db1d0529d5469dffe5c347fed3dbcd9/tumblr_inline_p8e6vzaEFp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc34fd48c5a43eb002a24332aad35492/tumblr_inline_p8e6w0RjIc1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fee55ca8961eef59668f2a5230adc331/tumblr_inline_p8e6w1ehSh1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4cf30081f85b5da8a8168a204c31a4be/tumblr_inline_p8e6w2VHg01qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/46c956b7f1876f16d184729b9b4702c3/tumblr_inline_p8e6w2vdQY1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5784ae86c2582d3e8ffc76c7ec833d8d/tumblr_inline_p8e6w3bf281qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb262fecbc1e5d7260279cf9dba84d63/tumblr_inline_p8e6w3m5sK1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b84b0c09ad64cf6e75d0182a7033de9/tumblr_inline_p8e6w3dELp1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e11ed857a98f4f5011cb3581f97e4a95/tumblr_inline_p8e6w3bbsb1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1c81bc137d4b897c2da9d3c616e5b5f8/tumblr_inline_p8e6w5PFLq1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/258586fe7cd7f4403afde0035717dab3/tumblr_inline_p8e6w5NBot1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a05eb7176295541252bbeead2ab7eda/tumblr_inline_p8e6w532nN1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7003917ddfe3ca96090dda798255ca77/tumblr_inline_p8e6w65HmR1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/80415b447c1425f1f3ed4e38df73604d/tumblr_inline_p8e6w6dShC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/55ff31a2d793b936febe4ff45475f8cb/tumblr_inline_p8e6w6D3bm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cec53e150302953ab0f233d1c901a7d5/tumblr_inline_p8e6w8dSTd1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3dc3b8bdeb8ee310ae5690cde71bf4b/tumblr_inline_p8e6w8bUS21qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f1f5b24296d9e7f10e625873babf11a1/tumblr_inline_p8e6w8HDLb1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfb122ef363e9a03d748be8525c4be62/tumblr_inline_p8e6w9HN5W1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f77b2f6ac69f211242f4a61457cf70b/tumblr_inline_p8e6vvDE0Q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nMost of the shoes we buy as style enthusiasts come from England, Italy, and the United States, but other countries have rich shoemaking traditions as well.

They look like a slightly less aggressive version of the region’s most famous style, and possibly an ideal choice to go with this coming season’s flannels and tweeds. \n\n_(Photos via [Ludwig Reiter](https://www.ludwig-reiter.com)\n, [StyleBop](http://bit.ly/1tLXZZ4)\n, [Manufactum](http://www.manufactum.com/ludwig-reiter-gentlemens-hunting-boots-russia-leather-p1464962/?a=20518)\n, [Shopikon](http://www.shopikon.com/s/vienna/ludwig-reiter-1-innere-stadt)\n, and [Ella La Petite Anglaise](http://www.ella-lapetiteanglaise.com/introducing-ludwig-reiter/)\n)_[](https://www.ludwig-reiter.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5218729b9140175369b0fd2690287ad2/tumblr_inline_p8e6vvmGZJ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c8f81eb44016e6f5457013d08223e6d2/tumblr_inline_p8e6vvEDs91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/95e706ae8db40c3e3de7936da2fa3c06/tumblr_inline_p8e6vwdgbt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e24fea5b0f600536fd5f3abf95f391b/tumblr_inline_p8e6vwizAo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b5ebf1e1647df6190449ee99c6e7eec/tumblr_inline_p8e6vw08861qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6045d881238a6ad03e5863c264560a3/tumblr_inline_p8e6vxss1s1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/846812a2257bfc51f5e195cbb392eae1/tumblr_inline_p8e6vxdMq21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/03d99cc3415c0492f94d0d5a524d4d6b/tumblr_inline_p8e6vxMUCS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/86005bbfe80c07d6a74f4f191bce4374/tumblr_inline_p8e6vyjFW91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dbb60a511d75cf5b6e820824b4340bf9/tumblr_inline_p8e6vys9re1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f92680b7a9598806af5fa6e42cad0f96/tumblr_inline_p8e6vyxqyK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f2fead69027567ae2771475b06aec91e/tumblr_inline_p8e6vzOL9I1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8db23ab725517fb076ca91c960af749c/tumblr_inline_p8e6vzYaan1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0db1d0529d5469dffe5c347fed3dbcd9/tumblr_inline_p8e6vzaEFp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc34fd48c5a43eb002a24332aad35492/tumblr_inline_p8e6w0RjIc1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fee55ca8961eef59668f2a5230adc331/tumblr_inline_p8e6w1ehSh1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4cf30081f85b5da8a8168a204c31a4be/tumblr_inline_p8e6w2VHg01qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/46c956b7f1876f16d184729b9b4702c3/tumblr_inline_p8e6w2vdQY1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5784ae86c2582d3e8ffc76c7ec833d8d/tumblr_inline_p8e6w3bf281qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb262fecbc1e5d7260279cf9dba84d63/tumblr_inline_p8e6w3m5sK1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b84b0c09ad64cf6e75d0182a7033de9/tumblr_inline_p8e6w3dELp1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e11ed857a98f4f5011cb3581f97e4a95/tumblr_inline_p8e6w3bbsb1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1c81bc137d4b897c2da9d3c616e5b5f8/tumblr_inline_p8e6w5PFLq1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/258586fe7cd7f4403afde0035717dab3/tumblr_inline_p8e6w5NBot1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a05eb7176295541252bbeead2ab7eda/tumblr_inline_p8e6w532nN1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7003917ddfe3ca96090dda798255ca77/tumblr_inline_p8e6w65HmR1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/80415b447c1425f1f3ed4e38df73604d/tumblr_inline_p8e6w6dShC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/55ff31a2d793b936febe4ff45475f8cb/tumblr_inline_p8e6w6D3bm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cec53e150302953ab0f233d1c901a7d5/tumblr_inline_p8e6w8dSTd1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3dc3b8bdeb8ee310ae5690cde71bf4b/tumblr_inline_p8e6w8bUS21qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f1f5b24296d9e7f10e625873babf11a1/tumblr_inline_p8e6w8HDLb1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfb122ef363e9a03d748be8525c4be62/tumblr_inline_p8e6w9HN5W1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Ready-to-Wear, but Hard to Find — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Ready-to-Wear, but Hard to Find — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Most of the shoes we buy as style enthusiasts come from England, Italy, and the United States, but other countries have rich shoemaking traditions as well.

It was inspired by a photo of George Frazier, a writer who started his career as a jazz critic before moving on to more general topics. In 1960, _Esquire_ published his essay titled [“The Art of Wearing Clothes,”](http://www.dandyism.net/the-art-of-wearing-clothes/)\n which in my opinion, is one of the best pieces of writing on men’s style that has ever been penned. A must read, if you haven’t already.\n\nRussell plaid is a distinctive check. It’s something like a [tan glen plaid,](http://bit.ly/1r55GHC)\n but with the horizontal stripes stripped away, so only the vertical ones remain. For the lateral sections, there are dark, thin lines, typically in plum, brown, or rust orange, which help balance the rest of the pattern. You can find it in the form of a made-to-order hacking jacket at [Leonard Logsdail](http://www.logsdailclassic.com/products/The-Sportsman-Jacket-in-Russell-Plaid.html)\n, or in [Harrisons](http://www.harrisonsofedinburgh.com/collections.html)\n and [Hardy Minnis’](https://www.hfwltd.com/)\n books if you’re going bespoke. Mine is from Harrisons (Porter & Harding’s Hartwist No. 32137), which is a darker color than the beigey version you’ll find from Hardy.\n\nThis jacket reflects Steed’s house style well, although I did have some things adjusted. The quarters are cut slightly more open, to give the jacket a dynamic look, but aren’t so open that I feel they define its style. I also asked for flapped welted pockets, rather than my usual patch, as I felt they’d give the tweed a certain kind of refinement. Additionally, I had the details done up in a more American or Italian sensibility, rather than British. The front is made with a 3/2 roll and a cheeky three buttons on each sleeve, rather than Steed’s default of four.\n\nEverything else, however, has been left the Steed. The co-founder of the house, Edwin DeBoise, previously worked as a cutter for [Anderson & Sheppard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAEg93I6LDI)\n and [Edward Sexton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrZIYmlIKdY)\n, and his tailoring style heavily reflects those experiences. His house cut is a type of London Drape, with soft, natural shoulders that slope down, ending in a somewhat full sleeve (albeit with high armholes) that tapers nicely to the cuff. The chest is sculpted and full, which gives a beanpole like me some shape, and the waist is nipped to accentuate the athletic look. The skirt is also cut close to the hips, which allows the line of the jacket to flow nicely into the trousers.\n\nFor those interested in getting something from Steed, they’re currently taking appointments for [their US tour next month](http://www.steed.co.uk/en/travel-itinerary/)\n. They do bespoke and made-to-measure, and have a nice [“Build a Wardrobe”](http://www.steed.co.uk/en/offers/build-a-wardrobe-promotion/)\n program for people who want to order multiple things at a slight discount. The best thing about working with Edwin, I think, is that you’re getting your cutter, fitter, and salesman all in one person, which can be helpful with a traveling operation. He’s also just a pleasure to deal with. To see more of his work, you can check out Steed’s most sartorially famous customer, [Voxsartoria](http://www.voxsartoria.com/tagged/steed)\n.\n\nI’ll be seeing Edwin and his son Matthew when they arrive in San Francisco in mid-October, and plan to order another jacket, but I doubt that I’ll be able to pick a fabric as great as this one. This might be the best sport coat I’ll ever own.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2578d2665427d69df34786b8331c5bc1/tumblr_inline_p827hzIcbR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ade783ade6ba2385e4e512cf6f64e6a/tumblr_inline_p827i0HPlQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bda9b965478c840c9924d838a3640b68/tumblr_inline_p827i0nYKF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c380bf312f8209e75dccbcbc5e243b5/tumblr_inline_p827i0ZOET1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/598d551adf2f818fd07c4dca34a5fc65/tumblr_inline_p827hzuFkS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nI may be speaking too soon – as this jacket is still in transit to me – but this Russell plaid sport coat by [Steed](http://www.steed.co.uk/)\n may be the best tailored jacket I will ever own.

For the moment, you can take 25% off your order with the checkout code FF25. Some notable items I found:\n\n*   **Footwear:** Brooks’ footwear continues to be the highlight of their inventory. Star picks include these Alden penny loafers in [shell cordovan](http://bit.ly/XpDd38)\n     and [suede](http://bit.ly/1uL1aOE)\n    , some very versatile [Norwegian split toes](http://bit.ly/Zs4wLI)\n    , and an absolutely knockout pair of [suede cap toe boots](http://bit.ly/1mh5p4c)\n     (made by Crockett & Jones). Perhaps most notable? Certain models of [Edward Greens](http://bit.ly/1p2CpZo)\n     are included in the promotion.\n*   **Outerwear:** These [duffle coats](http://bit.ly/1p2BA2N)\n     and [waxed field coats](http://bit.ly/1uKZsN8)\n     look pretty good. I have the second, but in a different color, and wear it with everything from grey flannel trousers to jeans. \n*   **Shirts:** There are some nice looking flannel shirts this season, which you can pair with your tweed sport coats and corduroy jackets. I particularly like this [navy plaid](http://bit.ly/XpB1so)\n    , [bold checked tan](http://bit.ly/1p2BHLW)\n    , and [mini-checked tan](http://bit.ly/Zs1pUd)\n    . The sale section also has some worthwhile [Black Fleece shirts](http://bit.ly/19Ex17S)\n    , such as [this amazing tartan](http://bit.ly/Zs1N4Q)\n    . And, of course, there are Brooks’ famous [oxford-cloth button-downs](http://bit.ly/1p2Jqtf)\n    , which are good for wearing with almost anything. \n*   **Luggage:** As usual, Brooks’ sales are still the best time to get [Filson luggage](http://bit.ly/16EbIjC)\n    . \n*   **Sale section:** Browse the [sale section](http://bit.ly/192ssbl)\n     to stack discounts. There are some [Peal chukkas](http://bit.ly/1p2CCvN)\n     that come down quite low with the promotion. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/17c1411dc43ab9ee46bf41d0af358516/tumblr_inline_peb3smBpFM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fff758135f6f0cdea88e4bdfe652ec86/tumblr_inline_peb3snlutU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7df193527701bf2576ee8cce736a8c0e/tumblr_inline_peb3snDUZP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/891499f42903f00f26c28087099f081f/tumblr_inline_peb3sn6PJK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2da22b34658680277241543526abf5ab/tumblr_inline_peb3soB5Jn1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/90c8e1c64703b427814a6d6323375511/tumblr_inline_peb3sokkFI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b03e0b2b1e73c5b9167300ed16f08eb/tumblr_inline_peb3spTwqx1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e0cb5567b9243641e32c532958c78e37/tumblr_inline_peb3smxId21qfex1b_540.png)\n\n[Brooks Brothers’](http://bit.ly/1bpu2iM)\n mid-season sale has started, coming almost a month earlier than usual.

Perhaps most notable? Certain models of [Edward Greens](http://bit.ly/1p2CpZo)\n     are included in the promotion.\n*   **Outerwear:** These [duffle coats](http://bit.ly/1p2BA2N)\n     and [waxed field coats](http://bit.ly/1uKZsN8)\n     look pretty good. I have the second, but in a different color, and wear it with everything from grey flannel trousers to jeans. \n*   **Shirts:** There are some nice looking flannel shirts this season, which you can pair with your tweed sport coats and corduroy jackets. I particularly like this [navy plaid](http://bit.ly/XpB1so)\n    , [bold checked tan](http://bit.ly/1p2BHLW)\n    , and [mini-checked tan](http://bit.ly/Zs1pUd)\n    . The sale section also has some worthwhile [Black Fleece shirts](http://bit.ly/19Ex17S)\n    , such as [this amazing tartan](http://bit.ly/Zs1N4Q)\n    . And, of course, there are Brooks’ famous [oxford-cloth button-downs](http://bit.ly/1p2Jqtf)\n    , which are good for wearing with almost anything. \n*   **Luggage:** As usual, Brooks’ sales are still the best time to get [Filson luggage](http://bit.ly/16EbIjC)\n    . \n*   **Sale section:** Browse the [sale section](http://bit.ly/192ssbl)\n     to stack discounts. There are some [Peal chukkas](http://bit.ly/1p2CCvN)\n     that come down quite low with the promotion. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/17c1411dc43ab9ee46bf41d0af358516/tumblr_inline_peb3smBpFM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fff758135f6f0cdea88e4bdfe652ec86/tumblr_inline_peb3snlutU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7df193527701bf2576ee8cce736a8c0e/tumblr_inline_peb3snDUZP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/891499f42903f00f26c28087099f081f/tumblr_inline_peb3sn6PJK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2da22b34658680277241543526abf5ab/tumblr_inline_peb3soB5Jn1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/90c8e1c64703b427814a6d6323375511/tumblr_inline_peb3sokkFI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b03e0b2b1e73c5b9167300ed16f08eb/tumblr_inline_peb3spTwqx1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Brooks Brothers' Friends & Family Sale — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Brooks Brothers' Friends & Family Sale — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Brooks Brothers’ mid-season sale has started, coming almost a month earlier than usual.

In fact, on this last visit, my fittings went so well that I added a new suit to the order – an olive cotton number with a suit jacket designed so it can be worn alone as a sport coat.

I may change the fabric, but with their next visit being in February, there’s still time to decide.

I’ve been wanting one for years. It’s the stuff of legends, and heavily sought after by style enthusiasts, but frustratingly hard to find.\n\nSchneider, for those unfamiliar, is a Belgian designer with a strong background in textiles, and works not only as a designer for his own label, but also as a professor at one of the fine arts universities in Berlin. His work is a breath of fresh air in men’s fashion, which nowadays seems to operate on two polar ends. There’s the heavy reliance on traditionalism and archival material on the one hand (e.g. traditional tailoring and old-timey workwear), and dark colors and aggressive silhouettes on the other (e.g. gothninja and its increasing number of derivatives).\n\nSchneider’s work is different. It has a subtle masculinity to it, with its looser cuts, rich fabrics, and warm uses of color. There’s admittedly nothing high-concept here – and many of the pieces are in some ways quite simple – but there’s always an element of design to keep one amused. Indeed, for the kind of guy who wants something a little different and contemporary, but doesn’t want to get too abstract, much of Schneider’s work fits the bill.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/562089f450fad1de92a14a4feb5df89a/tumblr_inline_pdeieeabkt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nTake this coat, for example. It’s a single-breasted topcoat with a knitted scarf liner. The liner and its accompanying hood can be kept in for a more causal and interesting look, and the hood can be propped up slightly to achieve the effect you see at the top of this post. For a more professional (or at least conservative) style, you can remove the hood and liner and use this piece as a simple topcoat. \n\nNo Man Walks Alone was able to get Schneider to reissue the coat in three new color combinations: [a charcoal nailhead body with a dark charcoal liner](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/exclusive-merino-coat-reissue-in-dark-charcoal-birdeseye-wool-with-charcoal-knit-liner.html)\n; [a deep green body with a cream liner](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/exclusive-merino-coat-reissue-in-forest-jade-green-wool-with-light-brown-knit-liner.html)\n; and a much heavier coat made with a [grey body and dark charcoal liner](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/exclusive-merino-coat-reissue-in-heavyweight-grey-melton-wool-with-charcoal-knit-liner.html)\n. Most of the stock is sold out, save for a few pieces in green, but some coats may get returned as people try to figure out their sizes. This one isn’t going back, however. It fits perfectly, and I’m already looking forward to when the weather gets cold enough for me to wear it. \n\n_(Pictured above: [Charcoal Merino coat](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/exclusive-merino-coat-reissue-in-dark-charcoal-birdeseye-wool-with-charcoal-knit-liner.html)\n by Stephan Schneider; cream basketweave sweater by [Inis Meain](http://bit.ly/1AQQsqP)\n; [double black straight legged jeans](http://www.3sixteen.com/collections/denim/products/sl-220x-straight-leg-double-black-selvedge-denim)\n by 3sixteen; and [black & white bball high-tops](http://bit.ly/1m9xZ7s)\n by Common Projects)._\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/62100118ff9e5ce73b73c4f95d991093/tumblr_inline_pdeieg7nIA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b1b614427410575d7feb059c47a0d123/tumblr_inline_pdeieg0GEN1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a2b4e573e9f3ff926ec4aab3d8a23bed/tumblr_inline_pdeiehdfju1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e178cec8b20ad3693bda6faac66cc06f/tumblr_inline_pdeiehfaDW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d034abcb9499ca26fa05efe3d1c3714c/tumblr_inline_pdeieiFpED1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e274bc923a5d39fa25cebd7051ae740/tumblr_inline_pdeieiiuCR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2a4da09a7178c76b717645e33306b6c/tumblr_inline_pdeieiY7Ud1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a817414aeebff25b91a6cb61466d4cf1/tumblr_inline_pdeiejXH881qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/51bdaa65736dd134ff1799e68473e08c/tumblr_inline_pdeiejJopg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/27871b0c416018bd4bbd95f1c2f5b95a/tumblr_inline_pdeiek6s3t1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9c257ef837d0c9705cfc3c9335f5b23/tumblr_inline_pdeiek9uQx1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0376c304f8027f8d87d73e82e069210/tumblr_inline_pdeielrc2w1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/055741a68ae181585f27cb3b65a9aa65/tumblr_inline_pdeiem68LR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c93fcd7e14f45d8203b00eb2cd44feae/tumblr_inline_pdeiemC0d61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bf0660abb5f03a86111101d8458b1bbb/tumblr_inline_pdeienrSgx1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f98cd7593f23a7e06bc551a0fba89113/tumblr_inline_pdeienie091qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0c4a9e461b1ec55d6ea6cae747046f3/tumblr_inline_pdeienEsnL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a658ce05fcffb43a6183f81d54f8b488/tumblr_inline_pdeieoi7VP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5857891d00b94ea5d6808c53955592f/tumblr_inline_pdeieoz6K81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a96472a1eefa1453616ed248ec400d3/tumblr_inline_pdeieoI9kd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfaa3cf5580f9d8ddc2d38204c2ce730/tumblr_inline_pdeiepZmNf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4910d4a34cabdf4909fee301ee046415/tumblr_inline_pdeiepLep31qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/03c247ffdd221a2707ece7fc4867f4c8/tumblr_inline_pdeieeBauJ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[No Man Walks Alone](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/)\n recently convinced [Stephan Schneider](http://www.stephanschneider.be/#/init/)\n to re-release his Merino Coat, which was originally part of his [FW11 Frozen Waves collection](http://www.stephanschneider.be/#/archive/aw2011/)\n. I’ve been wanting one for years. It’s the stuff of legends, and heavily sought after by style enthusiasts, but frustratingly hard to find.\n\nSchneider, for those unfamiliar, is a Belgian designer with a strong background in textiles, and works not only as a designer for his own label, but also as a professor at one of the fine arts universities in Berlin. His work is a breath of fresh air in men’s fashion, which nowadays seems to operate on two polar ends. There’s the heavy reliance on traditionalism and archival material on the one hand (e.g. traditional tailoring and old-timey workwear), and dark colors and aggressive silhouettes on the other (e.g. gothninja and its increasing number of derivatives).\n\nSchneider’s work is different. It has a subtle masculinity to it, with its looser cuts, rich fabrics, and warm uses of color. There’s admittedly nothing high-concept here – and many of the pieces are in some ways quite simple – but there’s always an element of design to keep one amused. Indeed, for the kind of guy who wants something a little different and contemporary, but doesn’t want to get too abstract, much of Schneider’s work fits the bill.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/562089f450fad1de92a14a4feb5df89a/tumblr_inline_pdeieeabkt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nTake this coat, for example. It’s a single-breasted topcoat with a knitted scarf liner. The liner and its accompanying hood can be kept in for a more causal and interesting look, and the hood can be propped up slightly to achieve the effect you see at the top of this post. For a more professional (or at least conservative) style, you can remove the hood and liner and use this piece as a simple topcoat. \n\nNo Man Walks Alone was able to get Schneider to reissue the coat in three new color combinations: [a charcoal nailhead body with a dark charcoal liner](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/exclusive-merino-coat-reissue-in-dark-charcoal-birdeseye-wool-with-charcoal-knit-liner.html)\n; [a deep green body with a cream liner](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/exclusive-merino-coat-reissue-in-forest-jade-green-wool-with-light-brown-knit-liner.html)\n; and a much heavier coat made with a [grey body and dark charcoal liner](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/exclusive-merino-coat-reissue-in-heavyweight-grey-melton-wool-with-charcoal-knit-liner.html)\n.

Granted, ten years is hardly timeless, but with how quickly fashion moves on the internet, that almost feels like a lifetime ago.\n\nAkamine has described his style as being traditionally British, but I actually think of it as a Japanese-Italian interpretation of British clothes. The fabrics are heavy, but the tailoring – save for a few sharply cut double breasted jackets – mostly looks soft and rounded. The shoulders are unconstructed and sloping, the lapels slightly extended, and the quarters gently curved. His shirt collars also look soft and unfused, and the points are long in a way that you almost only see in Southern Italy nowadays. For casualwear, he seems to favor the kind of slim fitting suede A-1 blousons that [Valstar](http://bit.ly/1vsiVT2)\n made famous in the 1960s, and like many Italians, pairs them with tailored trousers.\n\nAnd while much of what he wears feels conservative, there are some dandyish details. In several photos, he’s seen in a chunky rollneck sweater with a tweed sport coat, and a couple of his single-breasted jackets have both patch pockets and peak lapels (a daring combination). Plus, there are those deep, deep two-inch cuffs. On most men, these kind of things would seem affected, but on Akamine, they look so natural and good. Whether it’s because of that handsome face or his age, I don’t know.

term “timeless style” can feel like such a cliché nowadays, but it’s genuinely amazing how little — and how awesome — Yukio Akamine’s style has changed since I first saw him on [The Sartorialist](http://www.thesartorialist.com/)\n nearly ten years ago. Granted, ten years is hardly timeless, but with how quickly fashion moves on the internet, that almost feels like a lifetime ago.\n\nAkamine has described his style as being traditionally British, but I actually think of it as a Japanese-Italian interpretation of British clothes. The fabrics are heavy, but the tailoring – save for a few sharply cut double breasted jackets – mostly looks soft and rounded. The shoulders are unconstructed and sloping, the lapels slightly extended, and the quarters gently curved. His shirt collars also look soft and unfused, and the points are long in a way that you almost only see in Southern Italy nowadays. For casualwear, he seems to favor the kind of slim fitting suede A-1 blousons that [Valstar](http://bit.ly/1vsiVT2)\n made famous in the 1960s, and like many Italians, pairs them with tailored trousers.\n\nAnd while much of what he wears feels conservative, there are some dandyish details. In several photos, he’s seen in a chunky rollneck sweater with a tweed sport coat, and a couple of his single-breasted jackets have both patch pockets and peak lapels (a daring combination). Plus, there are those deep, deep two-inch cuffs. On most men, these kind of things would seem affected, but on Akamine, they look so natural and good. Whether it’s because of that handsome face or his age, I don’t know. I’ll give them a try when I’m in my 70s so I can at least tell if you if it’s the latter.\n\nTo see more of Akamine, you can visit [The Sartorialist](http://www.thesartorialist.com/)\n or either of Akamine’s two blogs – [Japan Gentleman’s Lounge](http://j-gentlemanslounge.com/)\n and [Incontro](http://www.incontro.jp/blog/)\n.

Bespoke cordwainers, tailors, and even the occasional fashion designer – people who produce the things that many of us love. A few years ago, I met Bellanie – the co-founder and craftswoman behind [Chester Mox](http://www.chestermox.com/)\n – when I was searching for a leather card case online. Since then, we’ve become friends, and I’ve had the fortune of seeing her skills as a leather worker develop. \n\nRecently, Bellanie graduated from an apprenticeship with a master craftsperson, and her whole line has undergone an overhaul. She sent me couple of pieces (on loan) to check out, and I can genuinely say: I think she’s setting new standards for what men can expect for their money. The last time I’ve been this impressed with a brand was with [Meermin](http://meermin.es/)\n – that Spanish shoe company that, I believe, has redefined affordable footwear. I think Chester Mox is now doing the same, except for high-end leather goods. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/558352863ea803e0d4ac7544220d97a3/tumblr_inline_pa6h5tx3Vw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/34feb36ab4c0df1b294f80805491569b/tumblr_inline_pa6h5t4DLc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5306f45cbbb6b2eee8aa0a28636acc1f/tumblr_inline_pa6h5tS0Ba1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nChester Mox’s new line is almost completely different from their old. They still make things from Horween leathers, but they also have some new materials from French and Italian tanneries – including those used by luxury houses such as Hermes and Louis Vuitton. Perhaps most importantly, the entire line is now saddle stitched by hand (including any internal components), and Bellanie’s technique is very, very good. \n\nAs some readers know, a saddle stitch is when two needles are passed through the same hole, either with an awl first piercing that hole and guiding one needle through, or with holes punched by hand using a pricking iron. This is the same technique used to sew moccasins or construct handmade luggage, and you can see it demonstrated in this [Hermes video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fHYcnrSie8)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb4e421099abf4826206b5084eb20e83/tumblr_inline_pa6h5ubQMl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d4246d9658e4d0af1d834e11b1f3e96/tumblr_inline_pa6h5uejz91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe process is incredibly time consuming, but the results are beautiful. Compare these two briefcases, for example. The green one is from Chester Mox and the tan from [Glenroyal](http://www.glenroyal.co.uk/)\n. When a leatherworker sews by hand, he or she can punch much smaller holes than what a machine can achieve, so with a thick leather, you can have a sturdy bag that’s still very refined looking. Just compare these two stitches-per-inch counts. If you tried to get something this fine with a machine, the leather would tear, much like the perforation on a stamp.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/203dee02e2c8e18fc302b01de4414525/tumblr_inline_pa6h5uZEFS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef670e8a1f6282c62d21eb16fc46fcb/tumblr_inline_pa6h5v20Fb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nHand stitching also allows for beautiful, slightly angled threadwork. Notice the threads angle a little as they move from one hole to the next, which differs from the straightaway threads on a machine-sewn seam. It’s a handsome detail – sort of like the decorative hand stitching you might see on finely made Italian suits or shirts.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f2192d248eabb74c532ad10c5e9ed132/tumblr_inline_pa6h5v7VOj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nAlso improved is Bellanie’s edge finishing, where the edges are burnished, painted, and then polished. This both helps to preserve the leather and aid the aesthetic finish. On the Glenroyal bag, these parts are a bit rougher, with the paint unevenly applied and the line between the two leathers still visible (though, no knock on them, as most luxury-end leather goods look like this). Bellanie’s, on the other hand, are completely seamless and smooth.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/33ff6f341daa40f8e059923c31a55ed7/tumblr_inline_pa6h5wn2A71qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/193d9e63cf22ab8848d9d13252b64957/tumblr_inline_pa6h5xCoNr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a90451ba12698b4ea391ec679fc042e/tumblr_inline_pa6h5xlwLZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nBellanie also loaned me one of her black alligator bi-folds to check out. The leather is soft and supple, the scales beautifully clean, and the leather doesn’t exhibit any of the dryness that you sometimes see in lower-end exotics. And while everything is still saddle stitched, the workmanship pops out more with the orange threads, which makes for a nice, subtle detail on the wallet’s interior. \n\nChester Mox is a small operation, with just Bellanie and her husband doing all the work. Since they’re the ones actually making the products, rather than hiring someone to do so, they’re able to offer very competitive prices. The [briefcase](http://www.chestermox.com/accessories/tristan-italian-green-minimalist-men-briefcase-leather-handmade.html)\n is completely hand sewn, but retails for $780 – a fraction of the price of luxury brands, who would charge two to three times as much for something of similar quality.

And since everything is made on order, modifications and even bespoke requests are possible.

Bespoke cordwainers, tailors, and even the occasional fashion designer – people who produce the things that many of us love. A few years ago, I met Bellanie – the co-founder and craftswoman behind [Chester Mox](http://www.chestermox.com/)\n – when I was searching for a leather card case online. Since then, we’ve become friends, and I’ve had the fortune of seeing her skills as a leather worker develop. \n\nRecently, Bellanie graduated from an apprenticeship with a master craftsperson, and her whole line has undergone an overhaul. She sent me couple of pieces (on loan) to check out, and I can genuinely say: I think she’s setting new standards for what men can expect for their money. The last time I’ve been this impressed with a brand was with [Meermin](http://meermin.es/)\n – that Spanish shoe company that, I believe, has redefined affordable footwear. I think Chester Mox is now doing the same, except for high-end leather goods. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/558352863ea803e0d4ac7544220d97a3/tumblr_inline_pa6h5tx3Vw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/34feb36ab4c0df1b294f80805491569b/tumblr_inline_pa6h5t4DLc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5306f45cbbb6b2eee8aa0a28636acc1f/tumblr_inline_pa6h5tS0Ba1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nChester Mox’s new line is almost completely different from their old. They still make things from Horween leathers, but they also have some new materials from French and Italian tanneries – including those used by luxury houses such as Hermes and Louis Vuitton. Perhaps most importantly, the entire line is now saddle stitched by hand (including any internal components), and Bellanie’s technique is very, very good. \n\nAs some readers know, a saddle stitch is when two needles are passed through the same hole, either with an awl first piercing that hole and guiding one needle through, or with holes punched by hand using a pricking iron. This is the same technique used to sew moccasins or construct handmade luggage, and you can see it demonstrated in this [Hermes video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fHYcnrSie8)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb4e421099abf4826206b5084eb20e83/tumblr_inline_pa6h5ubQMl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d4246d9658e4d0af1d834e11b1f3e96/tumblr_inline_pa6h5uejz91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe process is incredibly time consuming, but the results are beautiful. Compare these two briefcases, for example. The green one is from Chester Mox and the tan from [Glenroyal](http://www.glenroyal.co.uk/)\n. When a leatherworker sews by hand, he or she can punch much smaller holes than what a machine can achieve, so with a thick leather, you can have a sturdy bag that’s still very refined looking. Just compare these two stitches-per-inch counts. If you tried to get something this fine with a machine, the leather would tear, much like the perforation on a stamp.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/203dee02e2c8e18fc302b01de4414525/tumblr_inline_pa6h5uZEFS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef670e8a1f6282c62d21eb16fc46fcb/tumblr_inline_pa6h5v20Fb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nHand stitching also allows for beautiful, slightly angled threadwork. Notice the threads angle a little as they move from one hole to the next, which differs from the straightaway threads on a machine-sewn seam. It’s a handsome detail – sort of like the decorative hand stitching you might see on finely made Italian suits or shirts.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f2192d248eabb74c532ad10c5e9ed132/tumblr_inline_pa6h5v7VOj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nAlso improved is Bellanie’s edge finishing, where the edges are burnished, painted, and then polished. This both helps to preserve the leather and aid the aesthetic finish. On the Glenroyal bag, these parts are a bit rougher, with the paint unevenly applied and the line between the two leathers still visible (though, no knock on them, as most luxury-end leather goods look like this). Bellanie’s, on the other hand, are completely seamless and smooth.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/33ff6f341daa40f8e059923c31a55ed7/tumblr_inline_pa6h5wn2A71qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/193d9e63cf22ab8848d9d13252b64957/tumblr_inline_pa6h5xCoNr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a90451ba12698b4ea391ec679fc042e/tumblr_inline_pa6h5xlwLZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nBellanie also loaned me one of her black alligator bi-folds to check out. The leather is soft and supple, the scales beautifully clean, and the leather doesn’t exhibit any of the dryness that you sometimes see in lower-end exotics. And while everything is still saddle stitched, the workmanship pops out more with the orange threads, which makes for a nice, subtle detail on the wallet’s interior. \n\nChester Mox is a small operation, with just Bellanie and her husband doing all the work. Since they’re the ones actually making the products, rather than hiring someone to do so, they’re able to offer very competitive prices. The [briefcase](http://www.chestermox.com/accessories/tristan-italian-green-minimalist-men-briefcase-leather-handmade.html)\n is completely hand sewn, but retails for $780 – a fraction of the price of luxury brands, who would charge two to three times as much for something of similar quality. [Wallets also start at $40](http://www.chestermox.com/wallets.html)\n (although the photos used for older models are still being updated to reflect the new construction techniques). And since everything is made on order, modifications and even bespoke requests are possible. In fact, I’ve already ordered a custom eyewear sleeve to be made from that black alligator leather, which I’ll post photos of when I receive it. \n\nFrankly, for the price point and workmanship, I think this sets a new standard for the kind of leather goods Bellanie is producing. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dfb010a3dbf2ec05ff67df72479e26b2/tumblr_inline_pa6h5xUvJW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a773f6c0abfeae90a70efdeeb91b8e47/tumblr_inline_pa6h5yMCBK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4625ca67058d1fa6bb813cd68e4f0179/tumblr_inline_pa6h5yYGvk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7c1db69c8a87d67ff602e6c04ac5f2a/tumblr_inline_pa6h5yd0tG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fffa4a0677eb83ce835f2d396e19b4d7/tumblr_inline_pa6h5z02EF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f767cf43bbef97395c07de826090ea1/tumblr_inline_pa6h5zbGsq1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/72e0044cfb3440af8ba6bf41a414c4e2/tumblr_inline_pa6h5zPvcQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/229e14e873df7c3bfdce1da4cfa3c500/tumblr_inline_pa6h60ThMv1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fbfe7812531261f8050efcb60f769363/tumblr_inline_pa6h60H2cl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/20c04372385fbc183de18f6a6fc64dc4/tumblr_inline_pa6h60oBZF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/59f6b86082dcedf214abe86f233f73b1/tumblr_inline_pa6h61IoP51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab638bea97fac56d6ff3a9cc7b3a7044/tumblr_inline_pa6h61zYyn1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e089c1e99e6af68f5b1ee0de0dc6cb9f/tumblr_inline_pa6h62at2W1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/37263ca053e08f4bf409381de5574da3/tumblr_inline_pa6h62E3o21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31b47fb2ab7a4a9a1a182ba41cce1799/tumblr_inline_pa6h62GX4N1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb70fad74d849e5ebb17d059120dc2e4/tumblr_inline_pa6h62T0LT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c4ddf7827e81db25fdadad0b6b9c19f0/tumblr_inline_pa6h63j3zV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"New Standards — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"New Standards — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"One of the nice things about writing a menswear blog is that I get to meet people who actually make things.

A Fairchild Publication, M was launched in September of 1983 with a special issue on Prince Philip and navy blazers. It lasted just seven short years under the title of M the Civilized Man before it was changed to M Inc (Manhattan Inc) in 1990. About two years later, the magazine folded completely, with subscribers receiving GQ for the remainder of their subscriptions. \n\nFor the time it lasted, however, the publication was great. Especially during those early years. Although it wasn’t a fashion publication, per se, it was loosely centered on style. Every issue had a fashion spread, a feature on stylish men or places, and the occasional story on handsome items you might want to buy that month. There was also always a column at the end that would pose a rhetorical “why not?” As in, why not buy some fancy pajamas, or a three-piece suit, or a sweater with a big pheasant on it? (The last was a real, honest-to-God question posed by the magazine’s editors).\n\nTowards the end of the ‘80s, the publication gravitated towards Italian fashion and trendy casualwear, but the earlier issues felt a little more classic, if not at least British and American. In more recent years, John Tinseth over at [The Trad](http://thetrad.blogspot.com/)\n put together a [“best of M” book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/M-Civilized-1983-1989-John-Tinseth/dp/1576876144/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412695358&sr=1-1)\n, although I haven’t been able to find a copy. Peter Kaplan was also working to [re-launch the title](http://www.condenast.com/fairchild/ffm-press/press-releases/2012/05/23/fairchild-fashion-media-announces-relaunch-m)\n through Conde Nast before [he unfortunately passed away](http://putthison.com/post/68703943316/i-was-sorry-to-read-today-on-the-trad-that-peter)\n.\n\nYou can still find old copies of the magazine [floating around on eBay](http://bit.ly/1rSONPk)\n. The bindings are sometimes a little loose, but the content is arguably better than most men’s fashion magazines today. Just stick to those issues published before 1987 or so.

was cleaning up my apartment over the weekend when I came across a stack of old, forgotten issues from the now defunct M Magazine. A Fairchild Publication, M was launched in September of 1983 with a special issue on Prince Philip and navy blazers. It lasted just seven short years under the title of M the Civilized Man before it was changed to M Inc (Manhattan Inc) in 1990. About two years later, the magazine folded completely, with subscribers receiving GQ for the remainder of their subscriptions. \n\nFor the time it lasted, however, the publication was great. Especially during those early years. Although it wasn’t a fashion publication, per se, it was loosely centered on style. Every issue had a fashion spread, a feature on stylish men or places, and the occasional story on handsome items you might want to buy that month. There was also always a column at the end that would pose a rhetorical “why not?” As in, why not buy some fancy pajamas, or a three-piece suit, or a sweater with a big pheasant on it? (The last was a real, honest-to-God question posed by the magazine’s editors).\n\nTowards the end of the ‘80s, the publication gravitated towards Italian fashion and trendy casualwear, but the earlier issues felt a little more classic, if not at least British and American. In more recent years, John Tinseth over at [The Trad](http://thetrad.blogspot.com/)\n put together a [“best of M” book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/M-Civilized-1983-1989-John-Tinseth/dp/1576876144/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412695358&sr=1-1)\n, although I haven’t been able to find a copy. Peter Kaplan was also working to [re-launch the title](http://www.condenast.com/fairchild/ffm-press/press-releases/2012/05/23/fairchild-fashion-media-announces-relaunch-m)\n through Conde Nast before [he unfortunately passed away](http://putthison.com/post/68703943316/i-was-sorry-to-read-today-on-the-trad-that-peter)\n.\n\nYou can still find old copies of the magazine [floating around on eBay](http://bit.ly/1rSONPk)\n. The bindings are sometimes a little loose, but the content is arguably better than most men’s fashion magazines today. Just stick to those issues published before 1987 or so.

Foster & Son](http://foster.co.uk/)\n is in San Francisco this week, holding a trunk show at [The Wingtip](http://wingtip.com/)\n, which is a move from their regular location at The Fairmont Hotel. I was able to make it out yesterday to meet Andrew Murphy and Jon Spencer, who serve as the company’s retail manager and lastmaker respectively. With them were some samples from their ready-to-wear and bespoke range, as well as some vintage shoes that have been sitting in their archive for God knows how long.\n\nEverything looked lovely, but there were a couple of models in particular that caught my eye. One was a uniquely designed wingtip, with a swooping line from the shoe’s eyelets to the quarters, and then a winged cap toe to balance everything out. Apparently, it was modeled after an old design by Alan McAfee, who was a bespoke shoemaker on London’s Dover Street before going out of business sometime in the 1980s. And, among the ready-to-wear range, there was a side zip boot, which was modeled after something Foster & Son once made for a Sultan. His had a bright gold zipper and a taller heel, which accommodated some silver spurs. This RTW model is a bit more discreet, with a black tonal zipper, a regular heel, and no spurs. It’s perhaps better suited to someone who’s … um … not a Sultan.\n\nIn handling some of the vintage shoes, I noticed that the leather felt a little different. It was glossier and smoother, with a grain that was nearly invisible. I asked if this was because of the age of the shoe, or if there was something about the quality of calf leather fifty or sixty years ago. Both Jon and Andrew agreed that it’s the latter. It’s apparently harder to source good materials these days. Cows are made to grow faster and larger through modern industrial husbandry techniques – and since all leather is a by-product of the meat industry, that means most skins are too stretched out and thin to use for high-quality shoes.

Foster & Son](http://foster.co.uk/)\n is in San Francisco this week, holding a trunk show at [The Wingtip](http://wingtip.com/)\n, which is a move from their regular location at The Fairmont Hotel. I was able to make it out yesterday to meet Andrew Murphy and Jon Spencer, who serve as the company’s retail manager and lastmaker respectively. With them were some samples from their ready-to-wear and bespoke range, as well as some vintage shoes that have been sitting in their archive for God knows how long.\n\nEverything looked lovely, but there were a couple of models in particular that caught my eye. One was a uniquely designed wingtip, with a swooping line from the shoe’s eyelets to the quarters, and then a winged cap toe to balance everything out. Apparently, it was modeled after an old design by Alan McAfee, who was a bespoke shoemaker on London’s Dover Street before going out of business sometime in the 1980s. And, among the ready-to-wear range, there was a side zip boot, which was modeled after something Foster & Son once made for a Sultan. His had a bright gold zipper and a taller heel, which accommodated some silver spurs. This RTW model is a bit more discreet, with a black tonal zipper, a regular heel, and no spurs. It’s perhaps better suited to someone who’s … um … not a Sultan.\n\nIn handling some of the vintage shoes, I noticed that the leather felt a little different. It was glossier and smoother, with a grain that was nearly invisible. I asked if this was because of the age of the shoe, or if there was something about the quality of calf leather fifty or sixty years ago. Both Jon and Andrew agreed that it’s the latter. It’s apparently harder to source good materials these days. Cows are made to grow faster and larger through modern industrial husbandry techniques – and since all leather is a by-product of the meat industry, that means most skins are too stretched out and thin to use for high-quality shoes. Foster & Son works to get the best materials, but the supplies aren’t what they used to be.\n\nIf you’re interested in seeing Foster & Son, they’re at The Wingtip in San Francisco until tomorrow evening. After that, they’ll be in Chicago, Washington DC, Boston, and then New York.

While we were flipping through fabric books, I asked Edwin if he cuts jackets differently depending on his client’s body type. There’s been so much written about how certain silhouettes are better for certain builds (even down to the shape and width of the lapels). I was curious to hear Edwin’s view on this, since he’s actually the one cutting and fitting bespoke suits for customers.\n\nEdwin said he mostly works with customers to achieve what they want. One of his clients likes a much fuller chest than what he customarily cuts, so he provides that. Others might want something less drape-y. Some of his bodybuilding customers have big drops (meaning there’s a large difference between the chest and waist size), so on their jackets, he has to put in two darts instead of his usual one. (For me, a skinny man with a small chest and an expanding waistline, I imagine my jackets have a negative number of darts, but I haven’t checked). \n\nOther than that, however, he said he mostly goes by eye. When he fits someone, he and the client decide then what needs to be changed. Much like a tweed I recently brought back, which is cut like all of my other coats, but since it’s made from a very spongy Shetland, it looks bulky. Edwin and I agreed that it would look better with the shoulders and chest reigned in a little bit, so that they sit closer to the body, and that the length could be shortened. Nothing formulaic; just something we observed when I tried on the jacket.\n\nWhich makes sense, really. Even for a highly trained tailor such as Edwin, at the end of the day, he goes by his eye. Rules about fit or style are perhaps less rigid than we think, and our ideas about what a shorter or heavier man should wear, as compared to a taller or skinnier man, are probably more about Platonic ideals than reality. When it comes down to it, a garment should make you look good, and you can judge that by looking in the mirror. \n\nIn any case, Edwin and Matthew are touring the US this month. They’re in Nashville today, and then soon to be in Washington DC, New York City, and then Boston.

Until the end of today, [Salvatore Ambrosi](http://ambrosi-napoli.tumblr.com/)\n and Philip Car are holding trunk shows at [The Wingtip](http://wingtip.com/)\n. I stopped by yesterday morning to see them.\n\nThis is Ambrosi’s first trip to San Francisco in several years. After what seemed like a meteoric rise at The London Lounge and StyleForum, the bespoke trouser maker ran into problems with the same clients who originally sang his praises. I don’t know if those issues were ever resolved, but current clients are happy, so I decided to try a couple of pairs for myself. Bespoke trousers, of course, are a lot more straightforward than bespoke jackets – as they have less internal construction – but there are subtle nuances in the ways that the legs and waist are cut that can affect the silhouette. I’m looking forward to seeing what Salvatore makes, as the other stuff I’ve seen online and [in person](https://dieworkwear.com/post/21385195742/ambrosi-napoli)\n have been beautiful.\n\nPhilip Car was also on site showing his range of [Saint Crispin’s shoes](http://www.saintcrispins.com/)\n, which I think are the nicest around, short of going full bespoke. It’s confusing, but the terms that other companies use – such as “handgrade” and “benchgrade” – don’t actually mean the shoes were made by hand or on a bench. They’re just ways of denoting different levels of quality, such as “Gold” or “Platinum” Amex cards. Any shoe that was made with a Goodyear or Blake stitch is essentially a machine-made shoe (although, like Seinfeld said, [not that there’s anything wrong with that)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGAyQAkXajg)\n.\n\nSaint Crispin’s, however, are as about as handmade as you can get. The leathers are all handcut, rather than machine punched, which allows the worker to better account for the grain of the leather and ensure that the material will yield finer creases. Certain skins are also handstained, which allow them to age a bit more uniquely than “factory” tanned leathers. And, of course, the lasting and welting process are all done by hand. There’s some debate on whether handwelting is meaningfully better than machine welting, but I think everyone agrees that the first method is at least more traditional and artisanal, which for an enthusiast, have their own value.\n\nPhilip tells me that he’ll be back at the Wingtip every six months, so the next visit should be in March sometime. Salvatore, on the other hand, is coming back every two months (at least for the next year), which means if you order a pair today, you can be fitted in early December and receive your finished garment by Christmas. Going into 2015 in a new pair of pants sounds good to me. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/20259039b1e1dc541a1227f7f138b969/tumblr_inline_peb3melV0k1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/693204994dd69525af90e4e1c2d72aaa/tumblr_inline_peb3mfR1N51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4dd3dd0441bdd8acf5d91236aea9d549/tumblr_inline_peb3mf3BeU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d14ac21e48ee2cb6ba835ce5f774605/tumblr_inline_peb3mfHlPy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/81bbde3ca122aeac5300a615b6467d5e/tumblr_inline_peb3mg8eah1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e240f3e721f57106640e1994fa2caf27/tumblr_inline_peb3mgb29J1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f573ad80120cd07d43173b94d238baf/tumblr_inline_peb3mheFt11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ff2d4797ff3a5307a8e8d63c0767f24/tumblr_inline_peb3mhbwPN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb80d1b5cc7257f6fba1f746313d2855/tumblr_inline_peb3mimyB01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/14d67d224b219d222ef566c18ffa80b1/tumblr_inline_peb3mjXMuJ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e50ec45bcca9328168b64455e7eb1bf/tumblr_inline_peb3mjZA561qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a5d9248a0a92ea8980a3c9eb973548fb/tumblr_inline_peb3mkGTE61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f6b3e7018baeae0075986a2e7ac62f4/tumblr_inline_peb3mkh3Uw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1c26a028be3658abc57d4e1dd3045b9b/tumblr_inline_peb3ml9VOM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9582a9330f64bb0ae0d923f6d6962f91/tumblr_inline_peb3mlejUy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d11613dbb316ed6677cd6d5d59c9bcd9/tumblr_inline_peb3mmYEHo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ccc6383dc6183a4380032e652f6f54ac/tumblr_inline_peb3mmAwG51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f04e3312e582f12bfae3294c4185316/tumblr_inline_peb3mnIBeA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f3409846686fa7fb8ed28764ae5468b/tumblr_inline_peb3mnngaw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c427b8ca7862da71ea1e113683ec56b/tumblr_inline_peb3mo0lYC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6f5af73732c18b09c3057bbc36f9d9ae/tumblr_inline_peb3mobRPR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/17da7a0f56cddc0fb7fdf2789a2c0b5c/tumblr_inline_peb3mpHlZL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/55ef5df1efebf620cd46fb65c4078efd/tumblr_inline_peb3mp7f5J1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e2ff89325ad86fb386b4dcf62bf7d2e/tumblr_inline_peb3merhJV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe brotherhood of traveling pants and shoes are in San Francisco this week.

Certain skins are also handstained, which allow them to age a bit more uniquely than “factory” tanned leathers. And, of course, the lasting and welting process are all done by hand. There’s some debate on whether handwelting is meaningfully better than machine welting, but I think everyone agrees that the first method is at least more traditional and artisanal, which for an enthusiast, have their own value.\n\nPhilip tells me that he’ll be back at the Wingtip every six months, so the next visit should be in March sometime. Salvatore, on the other hand, is coming back every two months (at least for the next year), which means if you order a pair today, you can be fitted in early December and receive your finished garment by Christmas. Going into 2015 in a new pair of pants sounds good to me. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/20259039b1e1dc541a1227f7f138b969/tumblr_inline_peb3melV0k1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/693204994dd69525af90e4e1c2d72aaa/tumblr_inline_peb3mfR1N51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4dd3dd0441bdd8acf5d91236aea9d549/tumblr_inline_peb3mf3BeU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d14ac21e48ee2cb6ba835ce5f774605/tumblr_inline_peb3mfHlPy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/81bbde3ca122aeac5300a615b6467d5e/tumblr_inline_peb3mg8eah1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e240f3e721f57106640e1994fa2caf27/tumblr_inline_peb3mgb29J1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f573ad80120cd07d43173b94d238baf/tumblr_inline_peb3mheFt11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ff2d4797ff3a5307a8e8d63c0767f24/tumblr_inline_peb3mhbwPN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb80d1b5cc7257f6fba1f746313d2855/tumblr_inline_peb3mimyB01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/14d67d224b219d222ef566c18ffa80b1/tumblr_inline_peb3mjXMuJ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e50ec45bcca9328168b64455e7eb1bf/tumblr_inline_peb3mjZA561qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a5d9248a0a92ea8980a3c9eb973548fb/tumblr_inline_peb3mkGTE61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f6b3e7018baeae0075986a2e7ac62f4/tumblr_inline_peb3mkh3Uw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1c26a028be3658abc57d4e1dd3045b9b/tumblr_inline_peb3ml9VOM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9582a9330f64bb0ae0d923f6d6962f91/tumblr_inline_peb3mlejUy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d11613dbb316ed6677cd6d5d59c9bcd9/tumblr_inline_peb3mmYEHo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ccc6383dc6183a4380032e652f6f54ac/tumblr_inline_peb3mmAwG51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f04e3312e582f12bfae3294c4185316/tumblr_inline_peb3mnIBeA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f3409846686fa7fb8ed28764ae5468b/tumblr_inline_peb3mnngaw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c427b8ca7862da71ea1e113683ec56b/tumblr_inline_peb3mo0lYC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6f5af73732c18b09c3057bbc36f9d9ae/tumblr_inline_peb3mobRPR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/17da7a0f56cddc0fb7fdf2789a2c0b5c/tumblr_inline_peb3mpHlZL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/55ef5df1efebf620cd46fb65c4078efd/tumblr_inline_peb3mp7f5J1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Brotherhood of Traveling Pants and Shoes — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Brotherhood of Traveling Pants and Shoes — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"The brotherhood of traveling pants and shoes are in San Francisco this week.

I also have an old version of this [quilted jacket](http://bit.ly/1ziMwDJ)\n    , which is a perennial for the company. I bought mine five years ago and still wear it today with jeans and chukkas.

Pictured above is a [cream colored knit](http://www.ka-pok.com/webshop/men/knitwear/jumpers/a-kind-of-guise-sevket-crew-knit-ecru.html)\n is from the relatively new label A Kind of Guise. It has a groovy pattern – both figuratively and literally – that I think has a nice sense of playfulness. The [dark green A-1 blouson](http://bit.ly/1wsPyBz)\n is from Valstar (which at the moment is on deep discount at [Yoox](http://bit.ly/1vsiVT2)\n). It’s constructed from a rough, basketweave wool that has a much more visible texture than the pictures let on. Next, the [straight-legged jeans](http://www.3sixteen.com/collections/denim/products/sl100x-straight-raw-indigo-selvedge-denim)\n are from 3sixteen. They’ve been worn-in enough that the streaky grain on the denim has started to show. Finally, the [suede Alden chukkas](http://bit.ly/1Fz6kmX)\n are unlined, giving them a floppy and more relaxed character. \n\nYou can get good, textured casualwear at any number of places. Carson Street Clothiers has a [navy Eidos bomber](https://www.carsonstreetclothiers.com/shop/clothing/product/2628/pincioblouson)\n made from Casentino wool (which, along with all outerwear and tailoring, is on sale today at 30% off with the checkout code OW30). Much like the teased out fibers on a brushed Shetland sweater, Casentino wool is beaten until it achieves a charming, pilled look. For knitwear, No Man Walks Alone has some modern looking pieces from [Stephen Schneider](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/makers/makersinfo/view/id/150/)\n, while [S.N.S. Herning](http://www.mrporter.com/mens/designers/sns_herning)\n offers some really great designs rooted in traditional Nordic clothing (I really want this [dark striped sweater](http://bit.ly/1wj1Mfh)\n). Even with more traditional fabrics and designs, when [they’re paired in unexpected ways](http://bit.ly/1sNmeDB)\n, you can achieve a much more unique looking garment. \n\nAs usual, if you don’t want to wear a bunch of crazy patterns or colors, you can always try textures. Casualwear often has the more interesting ones. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/91d54fdc6b13300dd9f5fa60b2f7fa63/tumblr_inline_p8de2mnczr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a7a74b9709f9230a2d2e12e3dc1fdeac/tumblr_inline_p8de2nR0Vm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ecab84400c2a08d61ac7321fcc82cf20/tumblr_inline_p8de2oCAZx1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f5dee80c5036dde3d034ff3d8f70f97/tumblr_inline_p8de2pJ4GK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f207f8cce385f30e1b75cebf09ec5c82/tumblr_inline_p8de2pl9Yd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b50fe25f5bd6f86c804ef8a511de8d9/tumblr_inline_p8de2p0cb31qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b11e7ffb33d608464f64d42f38e84d60/tumblr_inline_p8de2rihes1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fcd7563208659f19bd5113d973d62d80/tumblr_inline_p8de2rdyou1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/95d501e05703a43faa0680e0bb7ab5f9/tumblr_inline_p8de2s3tZO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/59bb8ace2a47492dd14750d4d76f3bb5/tumblr_inline_p8de2sfuvb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e323eeca8f3fb82e31abc12b668c0d68/tumblr_inline_p8de2lKIPz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nTextures are often a lot more interesting in casualwear than they are in traditional, tailored clothing. Pictured above is a [cream colored knit](http://www.ka-pok.com/webshop/men/knitwear/jumpers/a-kind-of-guise-sevket-crew-knit-ecru.html)\n is from the relatively new label A Kind of Guise. It has a groovy pattern – both figuratively and literally – that I think has a nice sense of playfulness. The [dark green A-1 blouson](http://bit.ly/1wsPyBz)\n is from Valstar (which at the moment is on deep discount at [Yoox](http://bit.ly/1vsiVT2)\n). It’s constructed from a rough, basketweave wool that has a much more visible texture than the pictures let on. Next, the [straight-legged jeans](http://www.3sixteen.com/collections/denim/products/sl100x-straight-raw-indigo-selvedge-denim)\n are from 3sixteen. They’ve been worn-in enough that the streaky grain on the denim has started to show. Finally, the [suede Alden chukkas](http://bit.ly/1Fz6kmX)\n are unlined, giving them a floppy and more relaxed character. \n\nYou can get good, textured casualwear at any number of places. Carson Street Clothiers has a [navy Eidos bomber](https://www.carsonstreetclothiers.com/shop/clothing/product/2628/pincioblouson)\n made from Casentino wool (which, along with all outerwear and tailoring, is on sale today at 30% off with the checkout code OW30). Much like the teased out fibers on a brushed Shetland sweater, Casentino wool is beaten until it achieves a charming, pilled look. For knitwear, No Man Walks Alone has some modern looking pieces from [Stephen Schneider](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/makers/makersinfo/view/id/150/)\n, while [S.N.S.

That’s because most are started by enthusiasts – people who love men’s clothing, but don’t know how to make it, so they scout around for the same fabric suppliers and workshops that everyone else uses. As a result, we have dozens of companies at this point offering the same raw denim jeans, Macclesfield silk ties, and made-to-measure shirts.\n\nThis past Monday, my friend Agyesh launched what I think is one of the more interesting brands in a while. The company’s name, [Stoffa](http://stoffa.co/)\n, is Italian for “the stuff things are made of” (and sometimes used colloquially to mean “he’s got the right stuff”). Stoffa is about materials and process, which here are unique because of Agyesh’s background. He’s graduated from Parsons, is skilled in the arts, and worked for a while at [Isaia](http://www.isaia.it/)\n. As a result, he’s familiar with the supply chains, how to design, and how to make clothes on a technical level. \n\nTake [these scarves](http://stoffa.co/pages/product-scarves)\n, for example. Most scarves are made on large, modern looms, which produce rolls of fabric that are then cut down to size. Stoffa’s scarves, on the other hand, are produced on old, wooden, jacquard shuttle looms in Biella, Italy. They’re engineered to produce scarves to size, which means the scarves are finished with a selvedge edge. Since this is old 19th century technology, it also means that there’s no digital modeling for the patterns. Agyesh made these by actually investing in the equipment and experimenting with them – designing on the spot by adjusting the warp and weft threads here and there.\n\nHe’s not interested in old technology for the sake of old technology, however. You can tell that from the designs, which feel refreshingly modern (just browse the selection of ties and pocket squares). Agyesh tells me that he’s using these machines because they’re able to create a certain kind of open weave that he’s been unable to find anywhere else. A friend of mine, Stephen Pulvirent (formerly at [Hodinkee](http://www.hodinkee.com/)\n, but is now serving as an associate editor at Bloomberg) [recently wrote](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-21/accessories-brand-st-ffa-puts-process-first.html)\n that they have an interesting honeycomb-like structure and springy hand.\n\nThere are some other projects in the works, but I promised I wouldn’t reveal anything. Like what he has on the site now, however, those are being made by starting with a production process and moving backwards (this contrasts with what most other companies do, which is starting with a mood board and moving forward). It’s the materials and process that make Stoffa feel new. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/794569a9b2605da13aba0ae27adb17d7/tumblr_inline_padgvlbBzr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/711ac24d2ed86735d5f366d784c3206b/tumblr_inline_padgvnT1II1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4469e7191b52728cccfb0a931ec866d2/tumblr_inline_padgvoqOIQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2637ee63c0ed9317a3862880c0e2aa70/tumblr_inline_padgvoks4j1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/35f49187a5a088771bd9815e6513665b/tumblr_inline_padgvp3PDo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/49308328c309c2aeab5e18737593cb1f/tumblr_inline_padgvpsoEr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/264f7fde20c097dd7bb746fc31361745/tumblr_inline_padgvpE5fi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/41a95a1d054e876a12ff3c7f9a8a0ede/tumblr_inline_padgvqvMRu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e7a14640689f3c1f44aeffdd007e4f2/tumblr_inline_padgvqsCiz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c13d3e22abed0c3ce44e0e4b399e1561/tumblr_inline_padgvqW1dX1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/afe7475647a424bae27648e7c70233b3/tumblr_inline_padgvrwIVl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c06a1ef5804ae7268af0b852b3f0d83/tumblr_inline_padgvrQhll1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d1383d70ea997cb35447d6afc3737cb/tumblr_inline_padgvszvLW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/efbd7588f6da6f75362ea188b1d28c62/tumblr_inline_padgvstns81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7083fe3967dbffbe27d78fe7f22b4865/tumblr_inline_padgvsWTyj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6243ad82c4231c402b0817ec611a305/tumblr_inline_padgvtaA8A1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ae554c1db22150937056fbbbcf60049/tumblr_inline_padgvumSL01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba38cdf840994d5597f4214f6318effa/tumblr_inline_padgvugHa41qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ae71014ea1b65ab252a6681f9057faa/tumblr_inline_padgvuWjQz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ebd8cf2583df4acc9eb9204e4c6892bf/tumblr_inline_padgvv136a1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4d20734d608371c1333940d00d133ef2/tumblr_inline_padgvwjVpF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/267bf1ce02a91da3d634adfa32bde71a/tumblr_inline_padgvwc4Bx1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fefceca2409ac18a85dbfc89d5541aa1/tumblr_inline_padgvwB9ue1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/24bab29182c817849150a4cecf86de55/tumblr_inline_padgvyJklb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cfd785a9961e17ccba791ed9f6f04e70/tumblr_inline_padgvytCF51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2495144952d40a13c1d3aeb1df605f2f/tumblr_inline_padgvzYQM61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1c31b01a7d60d6123dfe727c3b050278/tumblr_inline_padgvlVMBq1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nDespite the explosion of new brands in the last few years, very few offer anything unique.

It’s the materials and process that make Stoffa feel new. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/794569a9b2605da13aba0ae27adb17d7/tumblr_inline_padgvlbBzr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/711ac24d2ed86735d5f366d784c3206b/tumblr_inline_padgvnT1II1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4469e7191b52728cccfb0a931ec866d2/tumblr_inline_padgvoqOIQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2637ee63c0ed9317a3862880c0e2aa70/tumblr_inline_padgvoks4j1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/35f49187a5a088771bd9815e6513665b/tumblr_inline_padgvp3PDo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/49308328c309c2aeab5e18737593cb1f/tumblr_inline_padgvpsoEr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/264f7fde20c097dd7bb746fc31361745/tumblr_inline_padgvpE5fi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/41a95a1d054e876a12ff3c7f9a8a0ede/tumblr_inline_padgvqvMRu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e7a14640689f3c1f44aeffdd007e4f2/tumblr_inline_padgvqsCiz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c13d3e22abed0c3ce44e0e4b399e1561/tumblr_inline_padgvqW1dX1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/afe7475647a424bae27648e7c70233b3/tumblr_inline_padgvrwIVl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c06a1ef5804ae7268af0b852b3f0d83/tumblr_inline_padgvrQhll1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d1383d70ea997cb35447d6afc3737cb/tumblr_inline_padgvszvLW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/efbd7588f6da6f75362ea188b1d28c62/tumblr_inline_padgvstns81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7083fe3967dbffbe27d78fe7f22b4865/tumblr_inline_padgvsWTyj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6243ad82c4231c402b0817ec611a305/tumblr_inline_padgvtaA8A1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ae554c1db22150937056fbbbcf60049/tumblr_inline_padgvumSL01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba38cdf840994d5597f4214f6318effa/tumblr_inline_padgvugHa41qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ae71014ea1b65ab252a6681f9057faa/tumblr_inline_padgvuWjQz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ebd8cf2583df4acc9eb9204e4c6892bf/tumblr_inline_padgvv136a1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4d20734d608371c1333940d00d133ef2/tumblr_inline_padgvwjVpF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/267bf1ce02a91da3d634adfa32bde71a/tumblr_inline_padgvwc4Bx1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fefceca2409ac18a85dbfc89d5541aa1/tumblr_inline_padgvwB9ue1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/24bab29182c817849150a4cecf86de55/tumblr_inline_padgvyJklb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cfd785a9961e17ccba791ed9f6f04e70/tumblr_inline_padgvytCF51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2495144952d40a13c1d3aeb1df605f2f/tumblr_inline_padgvzYQM61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Materials and Process — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Materials and Process — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Despite the explosion of new brands in the last few years, very few offer anything unique.

He once joked that I should change it to _Workwear to Die For_, given what I now sometimes wear. Maybe I should. Lately, I’ve been really into [Stevenson Overall Co.](http://www.soc-la.com/)\n, a Japanese label that offers the kind of quality you see from brands such as The Real McCoys, but is much more than just a straight vintage reproduction company.\n\nTake these [Santa Rosa jeans,](http://www.selfedge.com/jeans?product_id=772)\n for example. They were inspired by jeans made in the 1920s, before the invention of [bartacking machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kmKhgmT3SE)\n, so all the belt loops have been secured by running a single needle machine back and forth. In fact, the entire garment is single-needle made – even the two lines you see running around the curved pockets are just two single needle stitches running parallel to each other. The back pockets, coin pocket, and belt loops also feature a subtle scalloped design, which allow these to feel vintage without looking like straight reproductions. And of course, the unsanforized denim fades uniquely and beautifully. Just check the photos below and compare them to the smoother, less textured fades you see almost everywhere else.   \n\nPerhaps my favorite piece from them is this [brown cotton twill bomber](http://www.selfedge.com/jackets-vests?product_id=1184)\n. Absurdly simple, but with a trim fit, shearling collar, and an alpaca and wool lining, it’s been an easy go-to for me as temperatures drop. Even with just a t-shirt layered underneath, I feel comfortable enough for some of the Bay Area’s chillier nights.\n\nUnfortunately, the brand’s distribution at the moment is limited outside of Japan. They’re most easily found online through [Self Edge](http://www.selfedge.com/index.php?route=product/search&search=STEVENSON+overall&limit=35)\n, [Son of Stag](http://www.sonofastag.com/collections/stevenson-overall-co)\n, [Burg & Schild](http://www.burgundschild.com/list-en/brand/stevenson-overall-co.html)\n, and [Rivet & Hide](http://rivetandhide.com/index.php/brands/stevenson-overall-co.html)\n. [Bench & Loom](http://www.benchandloom.com/)\n also sometimes does collaborations with them through their subline, [Phoenix Project](http://www.phoenixproject.com/product/16)\n. Other than that, you can try contacting Stevenson directly, but I’ve had mixed luck.\n\nSo, there it is. I’ll eat crow and say this is workwear to die for. \n\n_(Brown flight jacket by [Stevenson & Co.](http://www.selfedge.com/jackets-vests?product_id=1184)\n, white pocket t-shirt by Barns, straight legged jeans from [Stevenson & Co.](http://www.selfedge.com/jeans?product_id=772)\n, mid-length wallet by [The Flat Head](http://www.selfedge.com/wallets?product_id=225)\n, silver double feather necklace by [J.

In fact, the entire garment is single-needle made – even the two lines you see running around the curved pockets are just two single needle stitches running parallel to each other. The back pockets, coin pocket, and belt loops also feature a subtle scalloped design, which allow these to feel vintage without looking like straight reproductions. And of course, the unsanforized denim fades uniquely and beautifully. Just check the photos below and compare them to the smoother, less textured fades you see almost everywhere else.   \n\nPerhaps my favorite piece from them is this [brown cotton twill bomber](http://www.selfedge.com/jackets-vests?product_id=1184)\n. Absurdly simple, but with a trim fit, shearling collar, and an alpaca and wool lining, it’s been an easy go-to for me as temperatures drop. Even with just a t-shirt layered underneath, I feel comfortable enough for some of the Bay Area’s chillier nights.\n\nUnfortunately, the brand’s distribution at the moment is limited outside of Japan. They’re most easily found online through [Self Edge](http://www.selfedge.com/index.php?route=product/search&search=STEVENSON+overall&limit=35)\n, [Son of Stag](http://www.sonofastag.com/collections/stevenson-overall-co)\n, [Burg & Schild](http://www.burgundschild.com/list-en/brand/stevenson-overall-co.html)\n, and [Rivet & Hide](http://rivetandhide.com/index.php/brands/stevenson-overall-co.html)\n. [Bench & Loom](http://www.benchandloom.com/)\n also sometimes does collaborations with them through their subline, [Phoenix Project](http://www.phoenixproject.com/product/16)\n. Other than that, you can try contacting Stevenson directly, but I’ve had mixed luck.\n\nSo, there it is. I’ll eat crow and say this is workwear to die for. \n\n_(Brown flight jacket by [Stevenson & Co.](http://www.selfedge.com/jackets-vests?product_id=1184)\n, white pocket t-shirt by Barns, straight legged jeans from [Stevenson & Co.](http://www.selfedge.com/jeans?product_id=772)\n, mid-length wallet by [The Flat Head](http://www.selfedge.com/wallets?product_id=225)\n, silver double feather necklace by [J.

The brand is a new ready-to-wear label by the knitwear factory [Esk Valley Knitwear](http://makeworks.co.uk/companies/EskValleyKnitwear/)\n, which is located in the southwest of Scotland. Having started in the 1960s, the family-owned business has been making knitwear for a number of high-end British brands for years. Now, they’ve gone into the ready-to-wear business for themselves.\n\nEsk Cashmere’s line is split into two parts. There’s the more [contemporary seasonal collection](http://www.eskcashmere.com/men/mens-autumn-winter-knitwear)\n and a [permanent classical line](http://www.eskcashmere.com/men/mens-classic-knitwear)\n. The latter is fairly straightforward – lots of basic crewnecks, v-necks, cardigans, and sweater vests made to the highest standards possible. Many are constructed from four-ply cashmere yarns or higher and seamlessly knitted on Shima Seiki machines. Being fully fashioned, the panels are knitted to shape (like a sock) rather than cut from larger pieces of cloth and then sewn together (like you would do for a shirt). The pieces are then skillfully assembled by hand-linking each stitch, point-by-point. This not only results in a smoother finish, but it’s also a slower, more labor intensive process that’s typically reserved for higher-end garments.\n\nThe contemporary collection is made to the same standards, but the designs are dramatically different. [Ex-Joseph](http://www.joseph-fashion.com/en/ecomuk/page/home)\n designer Lorraine Acornley works to make the sweaters look modern and distinctive, but also subtle. This [fisherman knit](http://www.eskcashmere.com/men/mens-autumn-winter-knitwear/james-Cashmere-and-Merino-Crew-Sweater-Vicuna)\n, for example, has contrasting, intarsia, color block patches at the forearms, while this [10-ply cashmere sweater](http://www.eskcashmere.com/men/mens-autumn-winter-knitwear?product_id=575)\n is made with a chunky collar and button detail. For something more discrete, check out these [Shetland crewnecks](http://www.eskcashmere.com/men/mens-autumn-winter-knitwear?product_id=535)\n. They’ve been knitted to be double-faced, so that a soft lambswool faces the inside, while the more traditional Shetland wool faces out.\n\nPrices here are expensive, but the line feels very promising. You can keep up with the brand by following them through their webstore, or checking out online stockists such as [Trunk Clothiers](http://www.trunkclothiers.com/brands/esk)\n and [Matches](http://bit.ly/1sGYX2E)\n. Esk Valley Knitwear has also done some work for [Monocle](http://monocle.com/search/esk/)\n, and some of their Esk Cashmere pieces are on sale at [Kafka](http://www.kafka.co.uk/browse/Mens/Sale/b-Esk-528/)\n and [Volls](http://volls.de/index.php?list=OUTLET_S)\n (albeit, in very, very limited quantities and styles). \n\n_(Photos via [Esk Cashmere](http://www.eskcashmere.com)\n and [Make Works](http://makeworks.co.uk/companies/EskValleyKnitwear/)\n)_\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/746029851efc5154b9cbba050f8ab569/tumblr_inline_p7lj6pmWKE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d335ec347d4519cb7beb040c1f89363e/tumblr_inline_p7lj6qZN3J1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/105e481a53ff2bd421320d3f4dc7d2dc/tumblr_inline_p7lj6qg6pF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2afa708df1c099b2682083c90b0f814d/tumblr_inline_p7lj6rTouh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6e6e22d76f441f07359a2a535718696f/tumblr_inline_p7lj6rco3c1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce023828a7e4aba315a03eb364a043ba/tumblr_inline_p7lj6rvCYr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5afda917f785b1451031ebbf0adeb7a/tumblr_inline_p7lj6sRo3X1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d92bd2dc5fbd39c1a7e25a8da1c9890e/tumblr_inline_p7lj6sfpHY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2abedd53b6712b5f9e0fd492637d81cc/tumblr_inline_p7lj6sAVAp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f96be9a4cd00497f784416dbbf55f248/tumblr_inline_p7lj6tEehE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ee031e1f2d190a7530976e2de19bbf9/tumblr_inline_p7lj6tXBwm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/83ddfd4650a71e7bca3220e72a735fa6/tumblr_inline_p7lj6uXGbA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a44d2b19e94dffd1c86dd43441f7bf16/tumblr_inline_p7lj6u5GY51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f87bb0ca26abf2461f1bbb545c78e0d6/tumblr_inline_p7lj6udNjg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c212cad92a8d4036f2efd7f1efd1e16f/tumblr_inline_p7lj6uYxb21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa754e1ce28ecacba85d661b644c1ea6/tumblr_inline_p7lj6vqQCL1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c538b8b491ecc536c91ac778bbcec2f/tumblr_inline_p7lj6v6kxK1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b61c098c7011551be68a1e10eb3a8236/tumblr_inline_p7lj6wDmQt1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/85aff7fa10e8ce1b6a167313fee44ad9/tumblr_inline_p7lj6xhcAw1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e1a8e25443256b6b1a018ff01d61d032/tumblr_inline_p7lj6xG23b1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/86f6cfa74fecf6727da575f0957fd92d/tumblr_inline_p7lj6y78vg1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/21814dc8967cf363f1bebac421c648ee/tumblr_inline_p7lj6yF7V01qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bdd5008c0f26bd862927bb5ede051f60/tumblr_inline_p7lj6zNOtu1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/101af40042be2b3f9177684e9a8e4ef7/tumblr_inline_p7lj6z7B0o1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/716cc95cb7ed5da240e7709db3b95434/tumblr_inline_p7lj70DHUg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ef6978340df63adb26e3ca3bda9a72c/tumblr_inline_p7lj70ZFgE1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2d72d5814b9589025e87c3302d3a6c8/tumblr_inline_p7lj71NaO11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc70d0a98bb0c882fb1fb4ef189c8941/tumblr_inline_p7lj72xMOk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/610a0e40c628ba72b3c906cfaeac1545/tumblr_inline_p7lj72Pr7r1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/24fe80fd1a5914ebed48a9b82b060e6a/tumblr_inline_p7lj724wSm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/192808850d1d76a5e1b046274bc07143/tumblr_inline_p7lj73Hkaq1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/934092623b892ac416e1c1e6ee859a6f/tumblr_inline_p7lj6pSsAF1qfex1b_540.png)\n\nFor those who can’t get enough knitwear, [Esk Cashmere](http://www.eskcashmere.com/)\n is worth keeping an eye on.

This not only results in a smoother finish, but it’s also a slower, more labor intensive process that’s typically reserved for higher-end garments.\n\nThe contemporary collection is made to the same standards, but the designs are dramatically different. [Ex-Joseph](http://www.joseph-fashion.com/en/ecomuk/page/home)\n designer Lorraine Acornley works to make the sweaters look modern and distinctive, but also subtle. This [fisherman knit](http://www.eskcashmere.com/men/mens-autumn-winter-knitwear/james-Cashmere-and-Merino-Crew-Sweater-Vicuna)\n, for example, has contrasting, intarsia, color block patches at the forearms, while this [10-ply cashmere sweater](http://www.eskcashmere.com/men/mens-autumn-winter-knitwear?product_id=575)\n is made with a chunky collar and button detail. For something more discrete, check out these [Shetland crewnecks](http://www.eskcashmere.com/men/mens-autumn-winter-knitwear?product_id=535)\n. They’ve been knitted to be double-faced, so that a soft lambswool faces the inside, while the more traditional Shetland wool faces out.\n\nPrices here are expensive, but the line feels very promising. You can keep up with the brand by following them through their webstore, or checking out online stockists such as [Trunk Clothiers](http://www.trunkclothiers.com/brands/esk)\n and [Matches](http://bit.ly/1sGYX2E)\n. Esk Valley Knitwear has also done some work for [Monocle](http://monocle.com/search/esk/)\n, and some of their Esk Cashmere pieces are on sale at [Kafka](http://www.kafka.co.uk/browse/Mens/Sale/b-Esk-528/)\n and [Volls](http://volls.de/index.php?list=OUTLET_S)\n (albeit, in very, very limited quantities and styles). \n\n_(Photos via [Esk Cashmere](http://www.eskcashmere.com)\n and [Make Works](http://makeworks.co.uk/companies/EskValleyKnitwear/)\n)_\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/746029851efc5154b9cbba050f8ab569/tumblr_inline_p7lj6pmWKE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d335ec347d4519cb7beb040c1f89363e/tumblr_inline_p7lj6qZN3J1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/105e481a53ff2bd421320d3f4dc7d2dc/tumblr_inline_p7lj6qg6pF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2afa708df1c099b2682083c90b0f814d/tumblr_inline_p7lj6rTouh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6e6e22d76f441f07359a2a535718696f/tumblr_inline_p7lj6rco3c1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce023828a7e4aba315a03eb364a043ba/tumblr_inline_p7lj6rvCYr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5afda917f785b1451031ebbf0adeb7a/tumblr_inline_p7lj6sRo3X1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d92bd2dc5fbd39c1a7e25a8da1c9890e/tumblr_inline_p7lj6sfpHY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2abedd53b6712b5f9e0fd492637d81cc/tumblr_inline_p7lj6sAVAp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f96be9a4cd00497f784416dbbf55f248/tumblr_inline_p7lj6tEehE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ee031e1f2d190a7530976e2de19bbf9/tumblr_inline_p7lj6tXBwm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/83ddfd4650a71e7bca3220e72a735fa6/tumblr_inline_p7lj6uXGbA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a44d2b19e94dffd1c86dd43441f7bf16/tumblr_inline_p7lj6u5GY51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f87bb0ca26abf2461f1bbb545c78e0d6/tumblr_inline_p7lj6udNjg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c212cad92a8d4036f2efd7f1efd1e16f/tumblr_inline_p7lj6uYxb21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa754e1ce28ecacba85d661b644c1ea6/tumblr_inline_p7lj6vqQCL1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c538b8b491ecc536c91ac778bbcec2f/tumblr_inline_p7lj6v6kxK1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b61c098c7011551be68a1e10eb3a8236/tumblr_inline_p7lj6wDmQt1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/85aff7fa10e8ce1b6a167313fee44ad9/tumblr_inline_p7lj6xhcAw1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e1a8e25443256b6b1a018ff01d61d032/tumblr_inline_p7lj6xG23b1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/86f6cfa74fecf6727da575f0957fd92d/tumblr_inline_p7lj6y78vg1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/21814dc8967cf363f1bebac421c648ee/tumblr_inline_p7lj6yF7V01qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bdd5008c0f26bd862927bb5ede051f60/tumblr_inline_p7lj6zNOtu1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/101af40042be2b3f9177684e9a8e4ef7/tumblr_inline_p7lj6z7B0o1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/716cc95cb7ed5da240e7709db3b95434/tumblr_inline_p7lj70DHUg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ef6978340df63adb26e3ca3bda9a72c/tumblr_inline_p7lj70ZFgE1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2d72d5814b9589025e87c3302d3a6c8/tumblr_inline_p7lj71NaO11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc70d0a98bb0c882fb1fb4ef189c8941/tumblr_inline_p7lj72xMOk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/610a0e40c628ba72b3c906cfaeac1545/tumblr_inline_p7lj72Pr7r1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/24fe80fd1a5914ebed48a9b82b060e6a/tumblr_inline_p7lj724wSm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/192808850d1d76a5e1b046274bc07143/tumblr_inline_p7lj73Hkaq1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Esk Cashmere — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Esk Cashmere — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"For those who can’t get enough knitwear, Esk Cashmere is worth keeping an eye on.

Rubinacci’s head cutter, Gennaro Paone, has decided to leave and start his own firm. Gennaro represents the last of his kind when it comes to Neapolitan tailoring. Having started in the trade with an apprenticeship at age nine, he makes the kind of softly tailored, old-school silhouettes that has made Naples famous, but surprisingly, younger tailors find difficult to produce. From what I’ve seen, there are really two kinds of Neapolitan style. The older generation cuts something slightly fuller and comfortable looking, while the younger generation makes something slimmer fitting and more influenced by local fashion brands. Neither better nor worse than the other, but for those who admire the look of men such as Vittorio De Sica, there’s a clear winner.  \n\nTo be sure, this isn’t Gennaro’s first stint on his own. After studying full time under master tailor Antonio Schiraldi, Gennaro set up his own workshop in the town’s main shopping district of _via Chiaia_. After eight years, he was asked to return and become the head tailor of Sartoria Schiraldi. Then, in the summer of 1992, he joined the famous London House (aka Rubinacci), where he’s been for over twenty years. \n\nAt the moment, Gennaro is planning to visit clients in The Netherlands and Hong Kong. A New York City trip is also very likely and I’m trying to get him out here to San Francisco. Partly because I think this is a unique opportunity to get something special, but mostly because I would like to commission some things for myself. More details to follow in the coming weeks. \n\nIn the meantime, you can follow Gennaro Paone on his [Tumblr blog](http://paone-sartorianapoletana.tumblr.com/)\n.

Photographer Jin Hidaka shot these vintage shoes and posted them on Flickr earlier this year. Many of them are in surprisingly good condition, given their age, which suggests maybe they were owned by a collector or just recently recrafted. \n\nSeen here are a bunch of John Lobb shoes from the 1980s and ‘90s; a pair of [Poulsen Skone formal pumps,](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11802656464/)\n made for Alan Flusser’s label; some custom, limited edition, [suede derbies from Alden](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11803005286/)\n, with a unique punch detailing around the quarters; [1980s espadrilles](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11802493493/)\n from Barney’s NY; and a pair of [New & Lingwood’s butterfly loafers](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11802657604/)\n, which I’ve been thinking about commissioning a version of through [Foster & Son](http://foster.co.uk/)\n. \n\nSome of my favorites, naturally, come from Ralph Lauren. [The double buckle boots](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11802247085/)\n you see above, for example, is Ralph Lauren’s take on the M-1943 service boot, which was worn by American servicemen in the Second World War. I recently bought a pair of boots that look very similar. I also really want these [alligator penny loafers](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11803007026/)\n, which apparently were sold at Ralph Lauren’s flagship store in 1983, and these [Russell Moccasin boots](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11802495023/)\n from the late ’70s. \n\nYou can see all of Hidaka’s photos [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/with/11802493493/)\n.

Many of them are in surprisingly good condition, given their age, which suggests maybe they were owned by a collector or just recently recrafted. \n\nSeen here are a bunch of John Lobb shoes from the 1980s and ‘90s; a pair of [Poulsen Skone formal pumps,](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11802656464/)\n made for Alan Flusser’s label; some custom, limited edition, [suede derbies from Alden](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11803005286/)\n, with a unique punch detailing around the quarters; [1980s espadrilles](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11802493493/)\n from Barney’s NY; and a pair of [New & Lingwood’s butterfly loafers](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11802657604/)\n, which I’ve been thinking about commissioning a version of through [Foster & Son](http://foster.co.uk/)\n. \n\nSome of my favorites, naturally, come from Ralph Lauren. [The double buckle boots](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11802247085/)\n you see above, for example, is Ralph Lauren’s take on the M-1943 service boot, which was worn by American servicemen in the Second World War. I recently bought a pair of boots that look very similar. I also really want these [alligator penny loafers](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11803007026/)\n, which apparently were sold at Ralph Lauren’s flagship store in 1983, and these [Russell Moccasin boots](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/11802495023/)\n from the late ’70s. \n\nYou can see all of Hidaka’s photos [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64933018@N06/with/11802493493/)\n.

Don’t waste any time mourning. Organize!” Those would be memorable last words, except Hill later followed with another telegram.

All three are called so because of they’re typically used for – to make horse saddles, harnesses, and bridle reins. They’re incredibly durable and strong materials (as they need to be for horse riding), but they differ in terms of their finishing. The less finishing, the more character a leather will develop as it ages. \n\nLast year, I bought a [harness leather belt](http://putthison.com/post/64212418390/the-beauty-of-a-naturally-aged-leather-belt-ive)\n from Scott. It came in a pale beige color, but has since darkened to a nice golden brown.

After that, I bought a [double-layer horsehide belt](http://putthison.com/post/88281961621/rugged-belts-for-jeans-theres-probably-a-theory)\n with a decorative “Clint” stitch. That too has darkened nicely with age. Then, this past month, I decided to go for the most evolution-prone material – saddle leather. One is pale beige; the other has been hand-stained brown. Unlike leather that has been traditionally dyed at the tannery, hand-staining allows scuffs and scratches to show more (since all the coloring is just at the surface). Perfect for the kind of evolution one hopes to see in Scott’s products. \n\n[Scott’s belts start at $65](http://www.dontmournorganize.com/store/)\n. Most don’t exceed $75, and that includes shipping. He also makes wallets and bags, and like with the key fob you see below, is available for custom jobs.

To be sure, they print and mail out catalogs year-round, but it’s their rubber duck boots, handsewn moccasins, and heavy field coats that feel so representative of the company – and so quintessentially fall.\n\nI’ve collected some of their catalogs throughout the years. Here’s one from 1959, which was printed just a short while after they first introduced their women’s wear collection. Like with most mail order catalogs (at those dealing with clothing), the women’s stuff is put at the front of the book, while menswear is placed at the back. Included in this one is also LL Bean’s outdoor gear spread throughout. I’ve skipped the women’s wear and outdoor supplies for the sake of brevity, but there are still plenty of menswear things to keep one amused.

To be sure, they print and mail out catalogs year-round, but it’s their rubber duck boots, handsewn moccasins, and heavy field coats that feel so representative of the company – and so quintessentially fall.\n\nI’ve collected some of their catalogs throughout the years. Here’s one from 1959, which was printed just a short while after they first introduced their women’s wear collection. Like with most mail order catalogs (at those dealing with clothing), the women’s stuff is put at the front of the book, while menswear is placed at the back. Included in this one is also LL Bean’s outdoor gear spread throughout. I’ve skipped the women’s wear and outdoor supplies for the sake of brevity, but there are still plenty of menswear things to keep one amused. And impressively, fifty-five years later, also plenty of things I’d happily buy. \n\nThe whole Americana trend seems to have passed, as fewer and fewer menswear blogs talk about brands such as LL Bean. However, as the writer behind Heavy Tweed Jacket once wrote about this stuff (when he was still writing), they feel forever appealing because they have a sense of “genuineness” to them.

For the kind of damp, cold weather we’ve been having, here’s a throwback Barbour catalog from the autumn of 1962 – printed back when the company still offered country suits and shoes. Those shoes used to be made by John White, a Northampton firm that has sadly gone into steep decline (I don’t believe they’re actually even made in the UK anymore). Those, of course, have been discontinued from Barbour’s line, but what remains is what Barbour has always been most known for: outerwear. \n\nHere you’ll find Barbour’s Thornproof coats for hunting and fishing; iconic belted International jackets (which back then was sold as part of a suit), and rubberproof riding coats. I actually spent a bit of time last week searching for a riding coat online, after having read [this post at _A Suitable Wardrobe_](http://asuitablewardrobe.blogspot.com/2014/10/mackintosh-season.html)\n. One seller I found described it as “something great for historical re-enactment.” That admittedly gave me some pause, but probably won’t stop me from eventually buying one. I’ll wear it to costume parties. \n\nAnother favorite is the anorak you see in the second-to-last photo below. Made from a densely woven, light fawn Gabardine, this piece featured an attached hood, a single Kangaroo pocket, and two flapped hip pockets.

love old clothing catalogs. For the kind of damp, cold weather we’ve been having, here’s a throwback Barbour catalog from the autumn of 1962 – printed back when the company still offered country suits and shoes. Those shoes used to be made by John White, a Northampton firm that has sadly gone into steep decline (I don’t believe they’re actually even made in the UK anymore). Those, of course, have been discontinued from Barbour’s line, but what remains is what Barbour has always been most known for: outerwear. \n\nHere you’ll find Barbour’s Thornproof coats for hunting and fishing; iconic belted International jackets (which back then was sold as part of a suit), and rubberproof riding coats. I actually spent a bit of time last week searching for a riding coat online, after having read [this post at _A Suitable Wardrobe_](http://asuitablewardrobe.blogspot.com/2014/10/mackintosh-season.html)\n. One seller I found described it as “something great for historical re-enactment.” That admittedly gave me some pause, but probably won’t stop me from eventually buying one. I’ll wear it to costume parties. \n\nAnother favorite is the anorak you see in the second-to-last photo below. Made from a densely woven, light fawn Gabardine, this piece featured an attached hood, a single Kangaroo pocket, and two flapped hip pockets. Internal wind cuffs helped keep the chill out and a drawcord waist helped give the garment some shape. If it were made today, I’d mostly certainly buy one.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6a7c409b9ce85611055514f7a7e2c2eb/tumblr_inline_p7yxv2KhJw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/514f8ba534e7ea3660c36b14d11e0d11/tumblr_inline_p7yxv2Dvw91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/75ffddced284f244b7c6b3da023f1775/tumblr_inline_p7yxv39HZQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/76e73aad62811470edab917a3ae2d215/tumblr_inline_p7yxv47GjC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/927c7abd2111649352e16ec377706d7a/tumblr_inline_p7yxv4KvuG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b894e560c5f93ab1d47ab666d0175f78/tumblr_inline_p7yxv5OUMF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/53700c1157c43f834088a6f097772113/tumblr_inline_p7yxv6cfX91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/003ec83ac97d2d88cdc616078a0c4012/tumblr_inline_p7yxv6sG321qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/978789d6927780a9db1dc1bdb5fe0393/tumblr_inline_p7yxv7AIZB1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b805679321c6aa9db745915b6af3f7c/tumblr_inline_p7yxv7VvJr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9cec618fe7420cd02e6754c681bc1407/tumblr_inline_p7yxv7NuXo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0d4e189ae1ffb0a3b81ff8063f1ea49/tumblr_inline_p7yxv9yHDK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/be6696f8b1d475d421d65867bd9f86a1/tumblr_inline_p7yxv9zcdI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/adc171825c2c10f81e5225147c4e5f28/tumblr_inline_p7yxvaj1SQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4fa9be32597768ba9750ce8b6c9c8dca/tumblr_inline_p7yxvaieGC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/59b8f769514f35b15d3ec2d77bbb24ef/tumblr_inline_p7yxvawETO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ef36e23b7d980158c603cf5ff95d35a/tumblr_inline_p7yxvbzuNi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0b80c855bdec852b10a00dc07ee5fce8/tumblr_inline_p7yxvbNQvC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a85d1416ee556a3170fc43cc39f76d11/tumblr_inline_p7yxvbIuN21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcbb671acbdecf64cb2edc516d727644/tumblr_inline_p7yxvcTQqf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f4efdbf6c2b8bc265c6c36e8d557c3ed/tumblr_inline_p7yxvcgXp01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07c940d19eae2492cd45182e8ac178c5/tumblr_inline_p7yxvdzT3I1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2c2b2237632ae06a3b2b05944de9536/tumblr_inline_p7yxvdELoe1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2610bb56097a400d444cfddb15b3b81/tumblr_inline_p7yxveHec81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/400fb0b2f384c9541401f4f91727e994/tumblr_inline_p7yxveJ0eJ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0c1fd91d308f789ad59a541374298fd/tumblr_inline_p7yxvejFko1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/94d1818cc9c18773c097fc172a0f23f1/tumblr_inline_p7yxvfdLRV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a4deb1c146e06ab27ed95f80f7e5289d/tumblr_inline_p7yxvfIghw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40e76ef406daef233837e367d7bd2353/tumblr_inline_p7yxvfqTtr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ec2b0aa29a4291567eab103c3acd6d3/tumblr_inline_p7yxvg4Fcy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bdf83a1a9800aa7b199741af0ee13e34/tumblr_inline_p7yxvgb4lf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b7dc4dde75d2cddc979d3f58115d1eb0/tumblr_inline_p7yxvgtOTa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9169449d46c3f61f73b12ef3e4952506/tumblr_inline_p7yxvhLfIG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ae375a8a8e7d90c7116cdf5f58b3cd3/tumblr_inline_p7yxvhuArF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9abf01cc2ff14bdaa5452ef0376dde0e/tumblr_inline_p7yxviN6ld1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e5bc2c88c75d2966eea10db1e79f8ef/tumblr_inline_p7yxvirfIW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/90eba6b91dee8a964d1e940d083cc119/tumblr_inline_p7yxvi6wty1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b982e9767d4ce07f54750a28931085e/tumblr_inline_p7yxvkzuwV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c4d470995c67b04c33e35287ba48b32a/tumblr_inline_p7yxvkAwWw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cabf7a8e0c48ed10ad4e934404bbc8e6/tumblr_inline_p7yxvljLRv1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1bdde0a74b4d62b0449ec36c19c14f72/tumblr_inline_p7yxvl7b2X1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/53fc804ad5e71eb6f4ed6732d21f5a85/tumblr_inline_p7yxvl1pk01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b19b0f691b30f90841c7bf19711a420e/tumblr_inline_p7yxvmooe11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n©

Last month, my friend David wrote an interesting history on Donegal tweed at [No Man Walk’s Alone’s blog](http://nomanwalksalone.tumblr.com/post/98985165491/county-donegal-and-its-tweed-by-david-isle)\n. \n\nAs David put it, Donegal tweed is the product of Irish self-efficacy and survivalism. Ireland has always been a major exporter of linen, but for most of its history, its wool production has lagged – thanks in part to British tariffs against foreign wool. As a result, the production of Donegal tweed maintained its labor-intensive methods well into the 20th century since there was no need for mass production. And when England established a trade board to help increase Irish linen production by distributing linen spinning wheels, the residents of Donegal – who lived in a climate too cold for growing flax – took those wheels and ingeniously made them spin wool.\n\nOf course, tweed in Donegal is now woven on modern machines, but its production remains fairly small and artisanal (at least when compared to other mills). [Molloy & Sons](http://molloyandsons.com/)\n, for example, is just a two-man operation (literally a Molloy and his son) that weaves in a small building next to the family’s home. Most of what they produce nowadays is for fashion labels in the US, Western Europe, and Japan (this season’s [Eidos’ field jacket](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/oatmeal-donegal-tweed-field-jacket-10-11-oz-wool-cashmere-5047.html)\n and [topcoat](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/blue-donegal-tweed-single-breasted-overcoat-19-oz-wool.html)\n was made from their cloth). My friend and colleague Jesse at Put This On made a great video about them [here](http://putthison.com/post/13112578469/donegal-tweed-at-molloy-sons-i-just-got-back)\n.\n\nBespoke customers can get Donegal tweed from a number of places. Molloy & Sons carries a permanent stock, which you can view on their [Flickr page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/molloyandsons/with/6792029757/)\n. They can send out swatches upon request and you can order cloths directly from them. [W. Bill](http://www.wbill.co.uk/)\n and Porter & Harding are also worth a look. Both are now managed by [Harrisons](http://www.harrisonsofedinburgh.com/)\n (who bought W. Bill earlier this year).

Last month, my friend David wrote an interesting history on Donegal tweed at [No Man Walk’s Alone’s blog](http://nomanwalksalone.tumblr.com/post/98985165491/county-donegal-and-its-tweed-by-david-isle)\n. \n\nAs David put it, Donegal tweed is the product of Irish self-efficacy and survivalism. Ireland has always been a major exporter of linen, but for most of its history, its wool production has lagged – thanks in part to British tariffs against foreign wool. As a result, the production of Donegal tweed maintained its labor-intensive methods well into the 20th century since there was no need for mass production. And when England established a trade board to help increase Irish linen production by distributing linen spinning wheels, the residents of Donegal – who lived in a climate too cold for growing flax – took those wheels and ingeniously made them spin wool.\n\nOf course, tweed in Donegal is now woven on modern machines, but its production remains fairly small and artisanal (at least when compared to other mills). [Molloy & Sons](http://molloyandsons.com/)\n, for example, is just a two-man operation (literally a Molloy and his son) that weaves in a small building next to the family’s home. Most of what they produce nowadays is for fashion labels in the US, Western Europe, and Japan (this season’s [Eidos’ field jacket](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/oatmeal-donegal-tweed-field-jacket-10-11-oz-wool-cashmere-5047.html)\n and [topcoat](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/blue-donegal-tweed-single-breasted-overcoat-19-oz-wool.html)\n was made from their cloth). My friend and colleague Jesse at Put This On made a great video about them [here](http://putthison.com/post/13112578469/donegal-tweed-at-molloy-sons-i-just-got-back)\n.\n\nBespoke customers can get Donegal tweed from a number of places. Molloy & Sons carries a permanent stock, which you can view on their [Flickr page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/molloyandsons/with/6792029757/)\n. They can send out swatches upon request and you can order cloths directly from them. [W. Bill](http://www.wbill.co.uk/)\n and Porter & Harding are also worth a look. Both are now managed by [Harrisons](http://www.harrisonsofedinburgh.com/)\n (who bought W. Bill earlier this year). You can get swatches through Harrisons, but the purchasing of cloth goes through their [distributors](http://www.harrisonsofedinburgh.com/agents.html)\n (which here in the US would be [Isles Textile Group](http://www.islestextilegroup.com/)\n).\n\nFor me, I just ordered two jacket lengths – a [light brown tweed](https://www.flickr.com/photos/molloyandsons/6792029757/)\n from Molloy & Sons, and a dark brown tweed from W.

They’ll be worn with other comfort clothes, such as suede boots and Shetland sweaters. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d93e214bdbab46be134f4742b08562f/tumblr_inline_p827ppvKFt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0ae8f5191f463158f65f0e4e080d081/tumblr_inline_p827ppZ3bz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/06820d306041e186cf93f36282f8b639/tumblr_inline_p827pqJOx31qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/36253c86e7e9603ee5d1b882e181150f/tumblr_inline_p827pqhgs31qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e7377374d7391f923874fd855f116a70/tumblr_inline_p827prYhYP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6a2bbb2c095c6d3967b257d01a3c1660/tumblr_inline_p827prNvj31qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ec0d1a722083d7978c66cd67c2f6e685/tumblr_inline_p827psSoaL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Donegal for Next Fall — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Donegal for Next Fall — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Just as we have comfort foods, we have comfort clothes – the soft feel of heavy flannel trousers; the familiarity of a button-down collar shirt; and the scratchiness of tweed that can make us feel protected.

Topcoats and overcoats, especially. With fewer and fewer men wearing suits and sport coats nowadays, retailers have little incentive to sell the kind of outerwear that traditionally accompanied them. We have a hundred companies at this point offering designer versions of the Army M-65 jacket, but perhaps a quarter of that number selling classic overcoats.\n\nSome styles have fared better than others, however. The generic, single-breasted topcoat is sold everywhere, and many American stores still offer the [polo](http://putthison.com/post/70498268986/polo-coats-despite-what-people-say-it-doesnt-get)\n. [Tweedy Ulsters](http://blog.styleforum.net/a-visit-to-panico-naples-part-ii/)\n and [wool Loden coats](https://dieworkwear.com/post/35641192134/aspesi-and-the-loden-coat)\n, on the other hand, are near impossible to find.\n\nOne coat that seems to hang by a thread is the Balmacaan – a long, loose-fitting style made with a fly front and raglan sleeves. Since it was designed to keep the rain and wind out, the collar can be buttoned all the way up to the neck, and the coat’s shell is typically made from a densely woven gabardine (like you’d expect for a trench) or heavy tweed. Supposedly, those raglan sleeves are also better at keeping the water out than set-in sleeves, but I’ve always thought that was marketing speak.  \n\nIn any case, there are only a handful of places anymore where you can buy a Balmacaan coat. As expected, [O’Connell’s](http://www.oconnellsclothing.com/)\n, [The Andover Shop](http://theandovershop.com/)\n, and [Cordings](http://www.cordings.co.uk/)\n are among them, and they’re about as traditionally styled as you can get (a reader just notified me of one at [Magee](http://www.magee1866.com/men-c1/new-arrivals-c57/classic-tweed-overcoat-corrib-p3886)\n, which also looks great). In addition, Camoshita offers them every now and again, typically in more fashionable designs. For example, this season’s model comes in a [waffle-textured wool](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/balmacaan-single-breasted-overcoat-brown-charcoal-waffle-textured-wool.html)\n, which can go over casual clothing just as well as a tailored jacket. After that, you can either go vintage or bespoke (vintage coats being especially good since they’re typically in great condition and are classically designed, but only cost a couple of hundred bucks). \n\nFor those interested in bespoke, Molloy & Sons has a [brown Donegal wool with orange and cream flecks of color](https://www.flickr.com/photos/molloyandsons/6791942019/)\n. I think it might be the perfect cloth for this kind of project. Have one made and wear it with with collar buttoned-up, like you see above, or worn more casually with the coat open and layered over another jacket. It would be a great thing for chilly days.  \n\n_(Photos via [Anton Helsinki](http://antonhelsinki.blogspot.com/2013/04/camoshita-by-united-arrows-pitti-uomo-83.html)\n, [The Sartorialist](http://www.thesartorialist.com/)\n, [No Man Walks Alone](http://nomanwalksalone.com/)\n, [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/forbes-life-magazine/2000/1113/Top_Coats_9-27.html)\n, [Cape Cod KG](http://capecodkg.exblog.jp/tags/in%20sync%20with/)\n, and [Molloy & Sons](https://www.flickr.com/photos/molloyandsons/with/6792029757/)\n)_\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e86b71e7ab5b18eea437b3671da5bad/tumblr_inline_p7ghhlvVhU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/223dc7a50c3f7fe66cdbf4df3d3db1a8/tumblr_inline_p7ghhmAC101qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3acf1b85775dc0621b686d1354dc4fa9/tumblr_inline_p7ghhmz3Ni1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b159d23ece261fd5fc360258d1f08369/tumblr_inline_p7ghhmoDj51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b547d8bcacbb488c5ec435f3561ef522/tumblr_inline_p7ghhnHKi01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/55700d33792c9985a60a5a66fffd8db6/tumblr_inline_p7ghhn4NF21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3cfbd1b8e2297941e7edc850a29f78a8/tumblr_inline_p7ghhp3hM11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/45363467458cde113ab344bae197b807/tumblr_inline_p7ghhpHTMr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ad8b842f158c2e57e61920bc2e6410f1/tumblr_inline_p7ghhp713E1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0f939ab11fca75228e9277b8a7b8a7f/tumblr_inline_p7ghhqWBVG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ca68f57adecf8c73fb0edbca772ee3c3/tumblr_inline_p7ghhqFnky1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5be444097b9cf9c3fef5112510b817ca/tumblr_inline_p7ghhqs05j1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e357d9d19be78f9c795472775aa76be6/tumblr_inline_p7ghhqzng91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/848aec1b6dded024f178956349e5fe10/tumblr_inline_p7ghhs2mAu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb2e6a4db53cd45b33b9653a2fbf92b8/tumblr_inline_p7ghhs65tZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/083f07ddad7e2e8a29e024593c870793/tumblr_inline_p7ghhtvXTZ1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a84bce718b32063ab412fa1d2341191/tumblr_inline_p7ghhlkBWH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nIt’s a shame how many classic styles of tailored clothing disappear as time moves on. Topcoats and overcoats, especially. With fewer and fewer men wearing suits and sport coats nowadays, retailers have little incentive to sell the kind of outerwear that traditionally accompanied them. We have a hundred companies at this point offering designer versions of the Army M-65 jacket, but perhaps a quarter of that number selling classic overcoats.\n\nSome styles have fared better than others, however. The generic, single-breasted topcoat is sold everywhere, and many American stores still offer the [polo](http://putthison.com/post/70498268986/polo-coats-despite-what-people-say-it-doesnt-get)\n. [Tweedy Ulsters](http://blog.styleforum.net/a-visit-to-panico-naples-part-ii/)\n and [wool Loden coats](https://dieworkwear.com/post/35641192134/aspesi-and-the-loden-coat)\n, on the other hand, are near impossible to find.\n\nOne coat that seems to hang by a thread is the Balmacaan – a long, loose-fitting style made with a fly front and raglan sleeves. Since it was designed to keep the rain and wind out, the collar can be buttoned all the way up to the neck, and the coat’s shell is typically made from a densely woven gabardine (like you’d expect for a trench) or heavy tweed. Supposedly, those raglan sleeves are also better at keeping the water out than set-in sleeves, but I’ve always thought that was marketing speak.  \n\nIn any case, there are only a handful of places anymore where you can buy a Balmacaan coat. As expected, [O’Connell’s](http://www.oconnellsclothing.com/)\n, [The Andover Shop](http://theandovershop.com/)\n, and [Cordings](http://www.cordings.co.uk/)\n are among them, and they’re about as traditionally styled as you can get (a reader just notified me of one at [Magee](http://www.magee1866.com/men-c1/new-arrivals-c57/classic-tweed-overcoat-corrib-p3886)\n, which also looks great). In addition, Camoshita offers them every now and again, typically in more fashionable designs. For example, this season’s model comes in a [waffle-textured wool](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/balmacaan-single-breasted-overcoat-brown-charcoal-waffle-textured-wool.html)\n, which can go over casual clothing just as well as a tailored jacket. After that, you can either go vintage or bespoke (vintage coats being especially good since they’re typically in great condition and are classically designed, but only cost a couple of hundred bucks). \n\nFor those interested in bespoke, Molloy & Sons has a [brown Donegal wool with orange and cream flecks of color](https://www.flickr.com/photos/molloyandsons/6791942019/)\n.

Will Boehlke was one of the first to blog about classic men’s style, and in his eight years of doing so, he’s always been one of the best. I recently had a chance to visit [his online shop’s](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/)\n headquarters – located just an hour outside of San Francisco, up in wine country – and chat with the writer about his operation. \n\nAs regular readers of _A Suitable Wardrobe_ will know, Will is moving his blog into his store, so that his editorial and commercial offerings will all be under one URL. It’s a move I’ve always thought he should make, if only for the convenience of his readers and customers. Unfortunately, his editorial content will also be shifting. Future posts will be more focused on his store’s products (like Mr. Porter’s _Journal_) and less free ranging. Certainly sad for those of us who have enjoyed Will’s daily musings, as well as those of his contributors. \n\nOn the upside, his store will be moving up-market. In the last five years, store buyers have been following in his footsteps (sometimes literally) as they track down where he buys his goods. Drake’s, EG Cappelli, and Inis Meain, for example, were all stocked at _A Suitable Wardrobe_ before they became commonplace everywhere else. To distinguish his store, Will has been depending less on Pitti Uomo (the menswear tradeshow where buyers meet brands), and instead has been scouring Europe on his own in order to find hidden artisans and craftsmen. A little hearsay from friends about a little-known, but exceptionally skilled, maker, for example, can lead to some great private label collaborations. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c53a0c8c94ea98c9ae33474ff42cdc2/tumblr_inline_peb3i5EUbs1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/53ea471ad0b99b9a55ac2137613d49a4/tumblr_inline_peb3i8VNVR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40e95029b93a76a198dff31f59e415d9/tumblr_inline_peb3i8iUTj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nWhile I was at the warehouse, Will let me shuffle through some his inventory. Seen above are samples of the [G.J. Cleverley crocodile card cases](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/accessories/leathergoods/side-opening-crocodile-wallet)\n and [Seraphin leather jackets](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/clothing/outerwear/lambskin-motorcycle-jackets)\n – both representing the best in their class. Most crocodile skins have tiny fissures in the scales, but these Cleverley wallets were perfectly clean (possibly the best I’ve seen outside of Hermes and small, high-end shops in Moscow).\n\nThe Seraphin jackets were similarly nice. Leather jacket makers often use lower-quality parts of a hide for the underarms of their sleeves (where few people would ever look), but Seraphin clearly spared no costs when they made these pieces. Everything here was smooth and soft, and the interior was even lined in silk. For men who want a leather jacket with enough refinement to pair with grey flannel trousers, these are the best you can get.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3fd521d60f0d7a95bcae88311f97e4d9/tumblr_inline_peb3i95gXy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e7b8fd374aea766dffc531b3d018cc6d/tumblr_inline_peb3i9wlIy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5387ee5ff4d2f719ebadf3faaec5913f/tumblr_inline_peb3i9pllV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThere was also a beautiful [silk dressing gown](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/silk-dressing-gowns)\n that made me question the Fox Flannel gown I’m currently having made. Constructed from necktie silk, this seemed like the perfect thing to throw over pajamas in the morning ([pocket squares](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/accessories/pocket-squares/large-paisley-pocket-squares)\n made from the same silk are also available, for those who want something they can wear outside). Additionally, there were some striking [Anthony Cleverley](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=anthony+cleverly)\n shoes, which really have to be seen in person to be appreciated. Most ready-to-wear shoes aren’t so beautifully shaped because they’re machine-made. By investing a bit more handwork, Cleverley has been able to add a bit more shaping to the waists and arches of their ready-to-wear shoes, giving them a streamlined look. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4b8f74ced775ea0b2b7c326cef582ec/tumblr_inline_peb3iaQETG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/02caa0b8be0b668e699932def001fe56/tumblr_inline_peb3iaGklA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9146eb783aca310b3f51c57e409d8568/tumblr_inline_peb3ibPfQh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/72340c7a74dcd6aa73a14e1a7f05f249/tumblr_inline_peb3ibjNNy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nI also spent some time admiring the handstitched [Merola gloves](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/makers/merola-gloves)\n, classic [Drake’s ties](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/makers/drake-s-london)\n, and beautiful [Rubinacci pocket squares](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/makers/rubinacci)\n. Like everything else in his store, Will’s accessories are some of the best you’ll find anywhere (I’m a particularly big fan of these [Victory squares](https://dieworkwear.com/post/44790355312/by-intelligent-design)\n). \n\nThose who read _A Suitable Wardrobe’s_ blog will undoubtedly miss the editorial musings of Will and his staff, but the blog’s archive (I’m happy to say) will remain alive in the store. Editorial content will continue to be produced; it will just be more product focused. And those who shop at _A Suitable Wardrobe_ will continue to have access to some of the best makers in the world (some of those items above, for example, were made by the same people who produce for [Charvet](http://www.charvet.com/)\n and [Hermes](http://www.hermes.com/index_us.html)\n). The taste level will also remain very high. It’s always been Will’s decades of experience with tailored clothing and his eye for style that made his blog great. Those kinds of things carry over naturally into his store.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a23206fdfe047ad10cb3e77ef088874/tumblr_inline_peb3ibWPN91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e8c143495bed924980d5b3e13c05b4b/tumblr_inline_peb3icqfRY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ad291fac4cf3f38e743a5829fd74b5d9/tumblr_inline_peb3icFVGq1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/131d96ccd1b1a8faef33ed20f8308241/tumblr_inline_peb3icIx9g1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc44c6dfc38df3376d661f1a5e7f7baf/tumblr_inline_peb3idNCLI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/819847a558b669059f41221371be2b0d/tumblr_inline_peb3idQYvG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/196bd11b29a3cb084e63ed18af1ac487/tumblr_inline_peb3id0BWi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3cce237aa1ac1421b3af84623deda44/tumblr_inline_peb3ieerWs1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c733a9c3a6bc383362aa241e9e4d15d/tumblr_inline_peb3ihGXqT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/03e201ddc916bcf7649ec7d205dd8f81/tumblr_inline_peb3ih8uNy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/358969781a27f9bb57871f319c66f2a0/tumblr_inline_peb3ii1SRC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8073b92a44f7fcbf06c157765b4d82f8/tumblr_inline_peb3iiNSQt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/60334fb3c0b62969e2258e3b512ed9c9/tumblr_inline_peb3iibDPl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d7cbb08338cf54002618f07e0eeaf3f/tumblr_inline_peb3ijLzAk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/90620cb8e5c4d2afefd78abe03241c17/tumblr_inline_peb3ijzy6v1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2370fbff16e95eb39922831520395f3/tumblr_inline_peb3ijL55s1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d3be0825defa50cc250d057c8f991c79/tumblr_inline_peb3i4gpq11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nAnyone with an internet connection and an interest in tailored clothing is sure to be familiar with [_A Suitable Wardrobe_](http://asuitablewardrobe.blogspot.com/)\n.

A little hearsay from friends about a little-known, but exceptionally skilled, maker, for example, can lead to some great private label collaborations. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c53a0c8c94ea98c9ae33474ff42cdc2/tumblr_inline_peb3i5EUbs1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/53ea471ad0b99b9a55ac2137613d49a4/tumblr_inline_peb3i8VNVR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40e95029b93a76a198dff31f59e415d9/tumblr_inline_peb3i8iUTj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nWhile I was at the warehouse, Will let me shuffle through some his inventory. Seen above are samples of the [G.J. Cleverley crocodile card cases](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/accessories/leathergoods/side-opening-crocodile-wallet)\n and [Seraphin leather jackets](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/clothing/outerwear/lambskin-motorcycle-jackets)\n – both representing the best in their class. Most crocodile skins have tiny fissures in the scales, but these Cleverley wallets were perfectly clean (possibly the best I’ve seen outside of Hermes and small, high-end shops in Moscow).\n\nThe Seraphin jackets were similarly nice. Leather jacket makers often use lower-quality parts of a hide for the underarms of their sleeves (where few people would ever look), but Seraphin clearly spared no costs when they made these pieces. Everything here was smooth and soft, and the interior was even lined in silk. For men who want a leather jacket with enough refinement to pair with grey flannel trousers, these are the best you can get.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3fd521d60f0d7a95bcae88311f97e4d9/tumblr_inline_peb3i95gXy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e7b8fd374aea766dffc531b3d018cc6d/tumblr_inline_peb3i9wlIy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5387ee5ff4d2f719ebadf3faaec5913f/tumblr_inline_peb3i9pllV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThere was also a beautiful [silk dressing gown](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/silk-dressing-gowns)\n that made me question the Fox Flannel gown I’m currently having made. Constructed from necktie silk, this seemed like the perfect thing to throw over pajamas in the morning ([pocket squares](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/accessories/pocket-squares/large-paisley-pocket-squares)\n made from the same silk are also available, for those who want something they can wear outside). Additionally, there were some striking [Anthony Cleverley](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=anthony+cleverly)\n shoes, which really have to be seen in person to be appreciated. Most ready-to-wear shoes aren’t so beautifully shaped because they’re machine-made. By investing a bit more handwork, Cleverley has been able to add a bit more shaping to the waists and arches of their ready-to-wear shoes, giving them a streamlined look. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4b8f74ced775ea0b2b7c326cef582ec/tumblr_inline_peb3iaQETG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/02caa0b8be0b668e699932def001fe56/tumblr_inline_peb3iaGklA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9146eb783aca310b3f51c57e409d8568/tumblr_inline_peb3ibPfQh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/72340c7a74dcd6aa73a14e1a7f05f249/tumblr_inline_peb3ibjNNy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nI also spent some time admiring the handstitched [Merola gloves](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/makers/merola-gloves)\n, classic [Drake’s ties](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/makers/drake-s-london)\n, and beautiful [Rubinacci pocket squares](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/makers/rubinacci)\n. Like everything else in his store, Will’s accessories are some of the best you’ll find anywhere (I’m a particularly big fan of these [Victory squares](https://dieworkwear.com/post/44790355312/by-intelligent-design)\n). \n\nThose who read _A Suitable Wardrobe’s_ blog will undoubtedly miss the editorial musings of Will and his staff, but the blog’s archive (I’m happy to say) will remain alive in the store. Editorial content will continue to be produced; it will just be more product focused. And those who shop at _A Suitable Wardrobe_ will continue to have access to some of the best makers in the world (some of those items above, for example, were made by the same people who produce for [Charvet](http://www.charvet.com/)\n and [Hermes](http://www.hermes.com/index_us.html)\n). The taste level will also remain very high. It’s always been Will’s decades of experience with tailored clothing and his eye for style that made his blog great. Those kinds of things carry over naturally into his store.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a23206fdfe047ad10cb3e77ef088874/tumblr_inline_peb3ibWPN91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e8c143495bed924980d5b3e13c05b4b/tumblr_inline_peb3icqfRY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ad291fac4cf3f38e743a5829fd74b5d9/tumblr_inline_peb3icFVGq1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/131d96ccd1b1a8faef33ed20f8308241/tumblr_inline_peb3icIx9g1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc44c6dfc38df3376d661f1a5e7f7baf/tumblr_inline_peb3idNCLI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/819847a558b669059f41221371be2b0d/tumblr_inline_peb3idQYvG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/196bd11b29a3cb084e63ed18af1ac487/tumblr_inline_peb3id0BWi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3cce237aa1ac1421b3af84623deda44/tumblr_inline_peb3ieerWs1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c733a9c3a6bc383362aa241e9e4d15d/tumblr_inline_peb3ihGXqT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/03e201ddc916bcf7649ec7d205dd8f81/tumblr_inline_peb3ih8uNy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/358969781a27f9bb57871f319c66f2a0/tumblr_inline_peb3ii1SRC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8073b92a44f7fcbf06c157765b4d82f8/tumblr_inline_peb3iiNSQt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/60334fb3c0b62969e2258e3b512ed9c9/tumblr_inline_peb3iibDPl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d7cbb08338cf54002618f07e0eeaf3f/tumblr_inline_peb3ijLzAk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/90620cb8e5c4d2afefd78abe03241c17/tumblr_inline_peb3ijzy6v1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2370fbff16e95eb39922831520395f3/tumblr_inline_peb3ijL55s1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Behind A Suitable Wardrobe — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Behind A Suitable Wardrobe — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Anyone with an internet connection and an interest in tailored clothing is sure to be familiar with A Suitable Wardrobe.

Like most people, I mainly wear wool, cotton, and linen, but rainy days offer the opportunity to wear something unique – something like Mackintosh’s bonded cotton. Here two pieces of fabric are bonded together using a rubber adhesive, the pieces are then cut and sewn, and the resulting garment is made waterproof by taping the seams. Andrew Yamoto over at [_A Suitable Wardrobe_](http://asuitablewardrobe.blogspot.com/2014/10/mackintosh-season.html)\n recently described Mackintosh coats as clothes that “rustle like sails,” and said they have an oddly comforting smell – like that of old, reliable camping gear – with their mix of rubber, canvas, and glue. I don’t think a better description can be given, but you have to wear a Mackintosh coat in order to understand the appeal. The specialness of the cloth just doesn’t come through a computer screen. \n\nThe company has expanded a lot in recent years. Along with their main label, they have two growing sublines in Japan aimed at hipper, younger customers. There’s [Traditional Weatherwear](http://www.tww-uk.com/)\n (the company’s original name before they changed it to Mackintosh) and [Mackintosh Philosophy](http://www.mackintosh-philosophy.com/)\n. Both include things such as Mackintosh jeans and sweaters, which – thankfully – are not made from bonded cotton. Distribution is limited to Japan.\n\nThe company’s best offerings, however, are still their mainline, traditional raincoats, which are available throughout the world. Some notable models to consider:\n\n*   **Dunkeld:** A slim-fitting coat that comes down to your knees, for those who want a more traditional look (or simply more protection). This is the model I own, and you can find it this season at [Trunk Clothiers](http://www.trunkclothiers.com/brands/mackintosh)\n     and [Unionmade](http://unionmadegoods.com/brands/mackintosh/)\n    .\n*   **Dunoon:** A contemporary, shorter-fitting version of the Dunkeld. Better for casualwear and light showers, given its length, it features slanted side entry pockets and, at times, a removable hood. You can find this model at [End](http://www.endclothing.com/brands/mackintosh)\n    , [Mr. Porter](http://bit.ly/1u021ax)\n    , [East Dane](http://bit.ly/1zzlEgy)\n    , and [No Man Walks Alone](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/makers/makersinfo/view/id/137#shopproducts)\n    .\n*   **Dalkeith:** A mid-length model that’s somewhere in between the Dunkeld and Dunoon. The Dalkeith features a corduroy collar and flapped pockets with corduroy underside trims. The pockets also feature two subtle rivets on either side. Available at [A Suitable Wardrobe](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/clothing/outerwear/gentleman-s-raincoats)\n    , [No Man Walks Alone](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/makers/makersinfo/view/id/137#shopproducts)\n    , and [J. Peterman](http://www.jpeterman.com/Favorite-Scottish-Coat)\n    .\n*   **Monkton:** The company’s trenchcoat, which drapes a bit differently from your more common gabardine. You can find it at [No Man Walks Alone](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/makers/makersinfo/view/id/137#shopproducts)\n    .\n*   **Special collaborations:** Mackintosh collaborates with other brands on a regular basis. In recent years, there’s been [Comme des Garcon](http://four-pins.com/style/comme-des-garcons-x-mackintosh/)\n    , [Junya Wantanabe](http://www.inventorymagazine.com/updates/junya-watanabe-x-mackintosh.html)\n    , and [Nigel Cabourn](http://www.oipolloi.com/nigel-cabourn-cameraman-raw-jacket--yellow)\n    . This season, they’ve made a few things for [Band of Outsiders](http://bit.ly/1zHJyXf)\n     and [C.H.C.M.](http://www.chcmshop.com/shop/?category=Outerwear)\n     There’s also this really beautiful line with [Hyke](http://www.mackintosh.com/hyke/en/index.html)\n    , although it’s for women only.\n\nIncidentally, Daniel Dunko – who set up the Mackintosh brand in the ‘90s (as before that, they were just a manufacturer) – recently left the company after he sold it to some Japanese investors. He now has a new label called [Hancock](http://www.hancockva.com/)\n (named after Charles Macintosh’s partner Thomas Hancock), which offers slightly more youthful takes on bonded cotton raincoats. For the more traditionally minded, they also make riding coats for [Cordings](http://www.cordings.co.uk/catalogsearch/result/?q=hampton+mackintosh)\n (something that Mackintosh used to produce, but no longer). Worth keeping an eye on if you’re as in love with this fabric as I am.\n\n_(Photos via [Mackintosh](http://www.mackintosh.com/)\n, [Freemans Sporting Club](http://freemanssportingclub.com/)\n, [Trunk Clothiers](http://www.trunkclothiers.com/)\n, [rcny1](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/152059-fs-junya-x-mackintosh-m65/)\n, [Oi Polloi](http://www.oipolloi.com/)\n, [Cordings](http://www.cordings.co.uk/)\n, [No Man Walks Alone](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/makers/makersinfo/view/id/137#shopproducts)\n, and [C.H.C.M](http://www.chcmshop.com/shop/?category=Outerwear)\n)_\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb9c3440bf86039fef2fd3d3bc54fd23/tumblr_inline_p9bwj5lPio1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fbd1c5ab8c12d901f2cc4c11ab4e96e9/tumblr_inline_p9bwj5r8Wp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/27395819f0f03c99a106e9931185cd99/tumblr_inline_p9bwj5Id5N1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a001729f227975f0dc4526c74b1c8f45/tumblr_inline_p9bwj6qcVP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/46ad8d023d786b91a1cb29b801231dc6/tumblr_inline_p9bwj6E6bl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a2484d3aa3b5967da4c35c41e99472a5/tumblr_inline_p9bwj6fucY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d80678d25d176b9510a4467078210081/tumblr_inline_p9bwj7J0wB1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f21627aee48b9deee638069dc9546ce3/tumblr_inline_p9bwj7QngD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b7f74ac2da6c94d720915c2ae1c57395/tumblr_inline_p9bwj7usKK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff50aac2781af92c07daed37692f1310/tumblr_inline_p9bwj9tvIS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a73c23b60caef8f72c1e6612b6ec857/tumblr_inline_p9bwjabXfw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82f49f6342714c55ed518aa21f5f4f99/tumblr_inline_p9bwjaptgr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f1013b05986ce54132b56eb7c13d291/tumblr_inline_p9bwjaNj4d1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8172b701dc7d66df320b62e2b178b84c/tumblr_inline_p9bwjbTUi51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/97343648e286caa7bd4a66f5818b8f15/tumblr_inline_p9bwjcZoHf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f8cc3aac84bd28a2a2f3f674b9086ef/tumblr_inline_p9bwjcm65i1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9feb275313990d8910480f5f0beaaa9/tumblr_inline_p9bwjconqg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/57cdadc953d23d2f7fbdd448a7a3468a/tumblr_inline_p9bwjdxtYV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8bc45d1ca248b0e9c2e256427e939858/tumblr_inline_p9bwjdynft1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/48edf2de2d55fa03ff1f93115f397304/tumblr_inline_p9bwjeIkKf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8b58cc54e0787c37a60c2ebc90743af/tumblr_inline_p9bwjfWzrF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07fc7719eb675583782a12609749448c/tumblr_inline_p9bwjfZNBR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1d8db99d87cdb5658e673fb103ac8dc3/tumblr_inline_p9bwjfLaHh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/034eea5b281cacc28cfae0f2a818f255/tumblr_inline_p9bwjgHoTH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/528a4cf7bce99879632056b88b5e7fa9/tumblr_inline_p9bwjgrJvX1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e66d5983b561354b3886ef7a48e95ede/tumblr_inline_p9bwjg31ip1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/190b69ca9be825bec551a68092e7868d/tumblr_inline_p9bwjhXwQ21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b7e51ff3d21d62cddf513362ceb36137/tumblr_inline_p9bwj4ehAO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nSan Francisco was hit with a pretty big storm yesterday, so I broke out my Mackintosh again and was reminded of how I love this coat.

He now has a new label called [Hancock](http://www.hancockva.com/)\n (named after Charles Macintosh’s partner Thomas Hancock), which offers slightly more youthful takes on bonded cotton raincoats. For the more traditionally minded, they also make riding coats for [Cordings](http://www.cordings.co.uk/catalogsearch/result/?q=hampton+mackintosh)\n (something that Mackintosh used to produce, but no longer). Worth keeping an eye on if you’re as in love with this fabric as I am.\n\n_(Photos via [Mackintosh](http://www.mackintosh.com/)\n, [Freemans Sporting Club](http://freemanssportingclub.com/)\n, [Trunk Clothiers](http://www.trunkclothiers.com/)\n, [rcny1](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/152059-fs-junya-x-mackintosh-m65/)\n, [Oi Polloi](http://www.oipolloi.com/)\n, [Cordings](http://www.cordings.co.uk/)\n, [No Man Walks Alone](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/makers/makersinfo/view/id/137#shopproducts)\n, and [C.H.C.M](http://www.chcmshop.com/shop/?category=Outerwear)\n)_\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb9c3440bf86039fef2fd3d3bc54fd23/tumblr_inline_p9bwj5lPio1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fbd1c5ab8c12d901f2cc4c11ab4e96e9/tumblr_inline_p9bwj5r8Wp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/27395819f0f03c99a106e9931185cd99/tumblr_inline_p9bwj5Id5N1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a001729f227975f0dc4526c74b1c8f45/tumblr_inline_p9bwj6qcVP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/46ad8d023d786b91a1cb29b801231dc6/tumblr_inline_p9bwj6E6bl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a2484d3aa3b5967da4c35c41e99472a5/tumblr_inline_p9bwj6fucY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d80678d25d176b9510a4467078210081/tumblr_inline_p9bwj7J0wB1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f21627aee48b9deee638069dc9546ce3/tumblr_inline_p9bwj7QngD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b7f74ac2da6c94d720915c2ae1c57395/tumblr_inline_p9bwj7usKK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff50aac2781af92c07daed37692f1310/tumblr_inline_p9bwj9tvIS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a73c23b60caef8f72c1e6612b6ec857/tumblr_inline_p9bwjabXfw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82f49f6342714c55ed518aa21f5f4f99/tumblr_inline_p9bwjaptgr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f1013b05986ce54132b56eb7c13d291/tumblr_inline_p9bwjaNj4d1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8172b701dc7d66df320b62e2b178b84c/tumblr_inline_p9bwjbTUi51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/97343648e286caa7bd4a66f5818b8f15/tumblr_inline_p9bwjcZoHf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f8cc3aac84bd28a2a2f3f674b9086ef/tumblr_inline_p9bwjcm65i1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9feb275313990d8910480f5f0beaaa9/tumblr_inline_p9bwjconqg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/57cdadc953d23d2f7fbdd448a7a3468a/tumblr_inline_p9bwjdxtYV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8bc45d1ca248b0e9c2e256427e939858/tumblr_inline_p9bwjdynft1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/48edf2de2d55fa03ff1f93115f397304/tumblr_inline_p9bwjeIkKf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8b58cc54e0787c37a60c2ebc90743af/tumblr_inline_p9bwjfWzrF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07fc7719eb675583782a12609749448c/tumblr_inline_p9bwjfZNBR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1d8db99d87cdb5658e673fb103ac8dc3/tumblr_inline_p9bwjfLaHh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/034eea5b281cacc28cfae0f2a818f255/tumblr_inline_p9bwjgHoTH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/528a4cf7bce99879632056b88b5e7fa9/tumblr_inline_p9bwjgrJvX1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e66d5983b561354b3886ef7a48e95ede/tumblr_inline_p9bwjg31ip1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/190b69ca9be825bec551a68092e7868d/tumblr_inline_p9bwjhXwQ21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Something Special for the Rain — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Something Special for the Rain — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"San Francisco was hit with a pretty big storm yesterday, so I broke out my Mackintosh again and was reminded of how I love this coat.

In the last year alone, there were 11.9 _billion_ catalogs sent to US addresses. Supposedly, they’ve stuck around because they help [inspire people’s purchases](http://www.kurtsalmon.com/en-us/Retail/vertical-insight/936/Is-the-Catalog-Dead-)\n. Mary Winter, a woman who was interviewed for the story, said she enjoys the tactile sensation of thumbing through catalogs at her leisure and marking them up. “I typically go online \\[…\\] and order whatever I’m getting,” she admitted, “but I still get my ideas from catalogs.”\n\nMaybe this is a story about how old habits die hard (anyone over the age of thirty can probably remember ordering much of their wardrobe through such books). Or maybe there’s something special about catalogs themselves. Compare Ben Silver’s catalogs to their website, for example. We skim things when we see them online, but linger when we see them on a printed page. There’s just something about how things can be laid out. (Incidentally, [Ben Silver’s catalogs](http://www.bensilver.com/onlinecatalogs.dlp)\n might be the best in menswear today, and I’m [not the only person who thinks so](http://www.thesimplyrefined.com/ben-silver-catalogs/)\n). \n\nPictured here are some scans of Brooks Brothers’ catalogs from the years 1979 to 1983 (before the Marks & Spencer takeover). Even when illustrated, oxford cloth button downs look better laid out than they do online, as do Shetland sweaters with little wool swatches set next to them (perhaps encouraging you to imagine what such colors might look like as a full sweater, rather than revealing directly).

had a story a few weeks ago](http://www.npr.org/2014/12/11/369603493/heres-why-retailers-keep-sending-you-catalogs)\n about how mail order catalogs have surprisingly survived in the Internet age, despite other things having gone by the wayside (e.g. the Rolodex, multivolume encyclopedias, and even physical maps). In the last year alone, there were 11.9 _billion_ catalogs sent to US addresses. Supposedly, they’ve stuck around because they help [inspire people’s purchases](http://www.kurtsalmon.com/en-us/Retail/vertical-insight/936/Is-the-Catalog-Dead-)\n. Mary Winter, a woman who was interviewed for the story, said she enjoys the tactile sensation of thumbing through catalogs at her leisure and marking them up. “I typically go online \\[…\\] and order whatever I’m getting,” she admitted, “but I still get my ideas from catalogs.”\n\nMaybe this is a story about how old habits die hard (anyone over the age of thirty can probably remember ordering much of their wardrobe through such books). Or maybe there’s something special about catalogs themselves. Compare Ben Silver’s catalogs to their website, for example. We skim things when we see them online, but linger when we see them on a printed page. There’s just something about how things can be laid out. (Incidentally, [Ben Silver’s catalogs](http://www.bensilver.com/onlinecatalogs.dlp)\n might be the best in menswear today, and I’m [not the only person who thinks so](http://www.thesimplyrefined.com/ben-silver-catalogs/)\n). \n\nPictured here are some scans of Brooks Brothers’ catalogs from the years 1979 to 1983 (before the Marks & Spencer takeover). Even when illustrated, oxford cloth button downs look better laid out than they do online, as do Shetland sweaters with little wool swatches set next to them (perhaps encouraging you to imagine what such colors might look like as a full sweater, rather than revealing directly). Most of us probably get our inspiration from online forums and blogs nowadays, but there will always be a special place in my heart for catalogs. \n\n_(photos via

The London Collections just concluded, and today is the start of Pitti Uomo. After that, there’s Milan’s Fashion Week, Bread & Butter, and a couple of events in NYC.\n\nIf you’re interested in following such shows, I find [Vogue](http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/autumn-winter-2015/mens/)\n, [StyleForum](http://www.styleforum.net/t/446303/pitti-uomo-87-the-sprezzening/0_20)\n, the [UK edition of GQ](http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/)\n to be good sites to follow.

For funny (fake) coverage of Pitti, follow [Voxsartoria’s Twitter account](https://twitter.com/voxsartoria/with_replies)\n.\n\nFrom the recent London Collections, here are a few presentations that caught my eye.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0360e321f5cac20d34d640b3bdc18370/tumblr_inline_peb3i5PUpo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9b59d354c1589e8e3955cc7395a9d71/tumblr_inline_peb3i5xj0l1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a8a019921c68c9d68e94087bcfe3b127/tumblr_inline_peb3i5Nrd41qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nI like the way **Nigel Cabourn** works. Not in the sense that he tweaks archival military and expedition clothing in a way that turns them into streetwear (a lot of people do that, although Cabourn arguably does it the best), but in the sense that he seems to eschew the usual practice of releasing totally new collections every season in order to help bolster sales and generate press. Much of what Cabourn makes stays the same from year-to-year, but when he does have a new design, it’s always fantastic. In the above, the Everest parka, Cameraman, and Mallory jackets remain perennials, while the belted Antarctic coat and naval clip jacket are new. Prices are likely to be expensive, but you can expect the level of detailing to be amazing.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/66172342e7e90016360cde24a588ef5e/tumblr_inline_peb3i7t2NW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c46b91792021735b83d4c3a5877bb44b/tumblr_inline_peb3i71Gq41qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/730b7b1943f2c790c730985487e994c0/tumblr_inline_peb3i72U441qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**Dunhill** had a number of great looks with autumnal colors, which were styled in an inspiring low-contrast way. In the above, you can see how mid- and dark-tones can still look distinct through their patterns, colors, or materials. Also, pin striped pants that somehow work well as odd trousers, and lots of chic, fuzzy mohair sweaters that are interesting enough to be worn on their own.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fc4531c5319ce4ea449434b6e6eca43/tumblr_inline_peb3i88P0c1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ff8cf87406bd70fdcaa8bd1b84c4708/tumblr_inline_peb3i8Zu7Q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**Hardy Aimes’** new overcoats look to be built from beautifully textured, almost vintage-like fabrics. There are some [interesting twills](http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/autumn-winter-2015/mens/hardy-amies/full-length-photos/gallery/1306869)\n, as well as [what looks](http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/autumn-winter-2015/mens/hardy-amies/full-length-photos/gallery/1306862)\n [to be some](http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/autumn-winter-2015/mens/hardy-amies/full-length-photos/gallery/1306882)\n stunning boucles. You can click on the small magnifying glass at Vogue’s website to zoom in for a better view. Kind of inspiring for bespoke projects, although finding these kinds of fabrics will be tough.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/86d8800cb8d86e4fb5b4b9f9e0434d0f/tumblr_inline_peb3i9FaLn1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/95c80ff406c24aec6052e73af7e90c4b/tumblr_inline_peb3i988yb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9fd0527fede00de4250d7d88a592361b/tumblr_inline_peb3idrnIo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nOne of the best designers for the kind of [warm minimalism](https://dieworkwear.com/post/107606205139/warm-minimalism)\n I wrote about last week, **Margaret Howell** has a fall/ winter collection that relies on what feels like very summery colors. Lots of simple slate grays and dusty tans, which were at times punctuated with a cheerful yellow coat or bright scarf. The clothes look simple, but it’s their fine materials and finishing that set them apart from high street brands. Admittedly, these kinds of things don’t translate well online, but the simplicity of these looks is still inspiring.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd1f3a2f7f0ddd59c3efb3187d35c45e/tumblr_inline_peb3idRxZ01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b55478b24156a704a7c5cf7d580e2dc/tumblr_inline_peb3idNYyW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7199e2ee4ff327d5ad5e600674ff1081/tumblr_inline_peb3ifOkLY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**John Lobb** recently hired Paula Gerbase of 1205 to be their artistic director, which I thought was a brilliant move. When it comes to classic shoes, I favor Edward Green and Crockett & Jones, and rarely find myself looking at Lobb’s offerings (although, they are very nice). Instead of trying to come up with “twists on classics,” I like the idea of a Northampton firm just making straight-up fashion forward shoes. Gerbase’s designs aren’t only trendy, and I like how they fit in with more modern modes of tailoring (Jil Sander, Maison Martin Margiela, and the like). \n\nThe debut collection relies on a lot of simple, at times subtle, detailing – silver buckle strap boots and single eyelet chukkas. There are also some Lanvin-esque sneakers, although the world hardly needs another minimalist sneaker offering.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/65df70fc8a592a34c7092bcaff42f35a/tumblr_inline_peb3ifMmuU1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/947c8c01b1712832203985b82be3f8ce/tumblr_inline_peb3igc9eL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nSpeaking of sneakers, Savile Row’s **Kilgour** is doing a collaboration next fall with **Adidas**. They look to be grey woolen versions of the company’s iconic tri-stripe sneakers. OK, I like these.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/293547feba2a732033571791c4ebb5b8/tumblr_inline_peb3igth3c1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5ac5573a13b9dae358c997b6e37491f/tumblr_inline_peb3igFoNm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nOf all the recent runway presentations, **Pringle’s** was one of the few with looks I would wear myself. Some simple wool jackets with turtlenecks and buckle boots, as well as leather jackets with dress trousers. Also, more low-contrast combinations that I think help make the ensembles look a bit more interesting.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/db1f86feffded9ef409df00512dbadd7/tumblr_inline_peb3ihsXV11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ac2c01131d1633b80875ab22eaf3df40/tumblr_inline_peb3ihEwSE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/13666e0802096f435aa41762dbc634e5/tumblr_inline_peb3iiLSIl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**YMC** often feels like it’s half about ‘80s youth culture and half about modern streetwear. In the above, a navy coat is paired with light washed jeans, while drawstring joggers look at home with the shirts and jackets that accompany them. Most of all, I like what the designer is wearing – loose fitting, raglan sleeved knit paired with a long-sleeved tee, not-overly-slim pants, and some burgundy boots.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/30abce5af3e7b142a479fb4e029b4b59/tumblr_inline_peb3iiQ85u1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/37433ecb94976858964bdf8c0ae99273/tumblr_inline_peb3iiIvut1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a282bd3220ec4aa11ab77ae72a5711f/tumblr_inline_peb3ijKDLN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nPeople have been talking about the death of slim silhouettes for five years, but every year, the look persists. Still, it’s bound to happen soon, right? **E. Tautz’s** latest presentation had some refreshingly voluminous pants paired with oversized coats. Really impressive collection from the already impressive Patrick Grant, who straddles of the world of menswear – he has one foot in the world of classic tailoring through his bespoke Savile Row firm, and another foot in the world of fashion through this ready-to-wear label. This show, more than any other he’s done, feels like it has a much more unified, cohesive look to me, which I’m hoping takes off for him.\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2c9218bfd8c3670fbff8c06ac2453e8/tumblr_inline_peb3i4nvPg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nJanuary marks the beginning of a number of fashion tradeshows and runway presentations.

Also, pin striped pants that somehow work well as odd trousers, and lots of chic, fuzzy mohair sweaters that are interesting enough to be worn on their own.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fc4531c5319ce4ea449434b6e6eca43/tumblr_inline_peb3i88P0c1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ff8cf87406bd70fdcaa8bd1b84c4708/tumblr_inline_peb3i8Zu7Q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**Hardy Aimes’** new overcoats look to be built from beautifully textured, almost vintage-like fabrics. There are some [interesting twills](http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/autumn-winter-2015/mens/hardy-amies/full-length-photos/gallery/1306869)\n, as well as [what looks](http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/autumn-winter-2015/mens/hardy-amies/full-length-photos/gallery/1306862)\n [to be some](http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/autumn-winter-2015/mens/hardy-amies/full-length-photos/gallery/1306882)\n stunning boucles. You can click on the small magnifying glass at Vogue’s website to zoom in for a better view. Kind of inspiring for bespoke projects, although finding these kinds of fabrics will be tough.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/86d8800cb8d86e4fb5b4b9f9e0434d0f/tumblr_inline_peb3i9FaLn1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/95c80ff406c24aec6052e73af7e90c4b/tumblr_inline_peb3i988yb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9fd0527fede00de4250d7d88a592361b/tumblr_inline_peb3idrnIo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nOne of the best designers for the kind of [warm minimalism](https://dieworkwear.com/post/107606205139/warm-minimalism)\n I wrote about last week, **Margaret Howell** has a fall/ winter collection that relies on what feels like very summery colors. Lots of simple slate grays and dusty tans, which were at times punctuated with a cheerful yellow coat or bright scarf. The clothes look simple, but it’s their fine materials and finishing that set them apart from high street brands. Admittedly, these kinds of things don’t translate well online, but the simplicity of these looks is still inspiring.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd1f3a2f7f0ddd59c3efb3187d35c45e/tumblr_inline_peb3idRxZ01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b55478b24156a704a7c5cf7d580e2dc/tumblr_inline_peb3idNYyW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7199e2ee4ff327d5ad5e600674ff1081/tumblr_inline_peb3ifOkLY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**John Lobb** recently hired Paula Gerbase of 1205 to be their artistic director, which I thought was a brilliant move. When it comes to classic shoes, I favor Edward Green and Crockett & Jones, and rarely find myself looking at Lobb’s offerings (although, they are very nice). Instead of trying to come up with “twists on classics,” I like the idea of a Northampton firm just making straight-up fashion forward shoes. Gerbase’s designs aren’t only trendy, and I like how they fit in with more modern modes of tailoring (Jil Sander, Maison Martin Margiela, and the like). \n\nThe debut collection relies on a lot of simple, at times subtle, detailing – silver buckle strap boots and single eyelet chukkas. There are also some Lanvin-esque sneakers, although the world hardly needs another minimalist sneaker offering.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/65df70fc8a592a34c7092bcaff42f35a/tumblr_inline_peb3ifMmuU1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/947c8c01b1712832203985b82be3f8ce/tumblr_inline_peb3igc9eL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nSpeaking of sneakers, Savile Row’s **Kilgour** is doing a collaboration next fall with **Adidas**. They look to be grey woolen versions of the company’s iconic tri-stripe sneakers. OK, I like these.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/293547feba2a732033571791c4ebb5b8/tumblr_inline_peb3igth3c1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5ac5573a13b9dae358c997b6e37491f/tumblr_inline_peb3igFoNm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nOf all the recent runway presentations, **Pringle’s** was one of the few with looks I would wear myself. Some simple wool jackets with turtlenecks and buckle boots, as well as leather jackets with dress trousers. Also, more low-contrast combinations that I think help make the ensembles look a bit more interesting.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/db1f86feffded9ef409df00512dbadd7/tumblr_inline_peb3ihsXV11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ac2c01131d1633b80875ab22eaf3df40/tumblr_inline_peb3ihEwSE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/13666e0802096f435aa41762dbc634e5/tumblr_inline_peb3iiLSIl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**YMC** often feels like it’s half about ‘80s youth culture and half about modern streetwear. In the above, a navy coat is paired with light washed jeans, while drawstring joggers look at home with the shirts and jackets that accompany them. Most of all, I like what the designer is wearing – loose fitting, raglan sleeved knit paired with a long-sleeved tee, not-overly-slim pants, and some burgundy boots.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/30abce5af3e7b142a479fb4e029b4b59/tumblr_inline_peb3iiQ85u1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/37433ecb94976858964bdf8c0ae99273/tumblr_inline_peb3iiIvut1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a282bd3220ec4aa11ab77ae72a5711f/tumblr_inline_peb3ijKDLN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nPeople have been talking about the death of slim silhouettes for five years, but every year, the look persists. Still, it’s bound to happen soon, right? **E. Tautz’s** latest presentation had some refreshingly voluminous pants paired with oversized coats. Really impressive collection from the already impressive Patrick Grant, who straddles of the world of menswear – he has one foot in the world of classic tailoring through his bespoke Savile Row firm, and another foot in the world of fashion through this ready-to-wear label. This show, more than any other he’s done, feels like it has a much more unified, cohesive look to me, which I’m hoping takes off for him.\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"The London Collections — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"The London Collections — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"January marks the beginning of a number of fashion tradeshows and runway presentations.

Like the loss of American denim, the Scottish cashmere industry has been reduced to a shadow of its former self, with most firms having either closed up shop or moved production offshore. In the last few years alone, [Caerlee Mills was shuttered](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-21994152)\n, Barrie Knitwear was [narrowly saved by Chanel](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-19968231)\n, and Berk lost their [location at the Burlington Arcade](http://www.permanentstyle.co.uk/2013/09/get-the-last-ballantyne-cashmere-ever.html)\n (although, there are plans to [reopen online](http://www.berkcashmere.co.uk/)\n). Thankfully, whisky and tweed remain, but Scottish cashmere as an industry seems to hang by a thread.\n\nMy friend Reginald Jerome de Mans – who has written [some of the](http://asuitablewardrobe.blogspot.com/2013/05/another-obit.html)\n [best articles](http://asuitablewardrobe.blogspot.com/2014/01/skipping-in-burlington-arcade.html)\n on this subject – likes to tell me how good Scottish cashmere used to be, before its decline. Densely knitted from long hair yarns, such sweaters are said to not pill or lose shape easily. They were also not as soft – at least not straight of out the box. Instead, softness had to be beaten into them, like character into raw denim. Simon Crompton thinks the softness in modern sweaters is [a result of over-milling](http://www.permanentstyle.co.uk/2013/09/get-the-last-ballantyne-cashmere-ever.html)\n; Jesse at Put This On believes its from [shorter hairs in yarns](http://putthison.com/post/33160138133/old-cashmere-is-better-heres-the-honest-truth)\n; one manager I spoke to says its because such sweaters aren’t knit tightly enough. Whatever the reason, it seems most companies have sacrificed durability for a more luxurious hand.\n\nI was finally able to try one of these famed sweaters last year, when I bought a cable knit from [William Lockie](http://www.williamlockie.com/index.php)\n. It’s a world apart from any cashmere sweater I’ve ever owned. Certainly better than those I’ve bought from Italian and Chinese makers, but even better the ones from Scotland. The [Johnstons of Elgin](http://bit.ly/1L4Y5la)\n I picked up from Sierra Trading Post pilled easily, while a Barrie-made sweater stretched out after just a few wears. I don’t know if that’s because it was made from a two-ply yarn or because it was too loosely knitted. Either way, at the price Barrie commands, I wasn’t willing to try again.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e34ff2bf17ac27abc04c256375c859b7/tumblr_inline_pe157pRgeY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe William Lockie sweater, however, has been fantastic. It’s considerably more durable and only gets softer with each (hand) wash. I was so impressed with the one I bought last year that I recently picked up a few more.\n\nYou can find them online at William Lockie’s store, [Heather Wallace](http://www.heatherwallace.com/)\n. The smallest size for most models is 42” (meaning, that’s the actual measured chest size). If you need something smaller, like me, you’ll have to place a special order. Sweaters can be made with any of Lockie’s yarns, although their online swatches aren’t terribly helpful. For reference, pictured below are: navy, bottle, linen, mushroom, flannel, and derby. This [Melrose product page](http://www.heatherwallace.com/men_cashmere_detail.php?prod_ID=32)\n seems to list most of their colors, but you may want to search around the site for more. \n\nMr. Porter also carries the [Oxton model](http://bit.ly/1BRw9P6)\n, but again – it’s a single-ply and I don’t know if low-ply yarns are more likely to lose shape. If anyone were to get it right, however, I’d trust Lockie. The upside to single- and two-ply sweaters is that you layer them underneath sport coats. These [four-ply Chirnside knits](http://www.heatherwallace.com/men_cashmere_detail.php?prod_ID=35)\n are only good with outerwear.\n\nI have an interview with Allan Gilchrist from William Lockie going up at [Put This On](http://putthison.com/)\n at some point.

Like the loss of American denim, the Scottish cashmere industry has been reduced to a shadow of its former self, with most firms having either closed up shop or moved production offshore. In the last few years alone, [Caerlee Mills was shuttered](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-21994152)\n, Barrie Knitwear was [narrowly saved by Chanel](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-19968231)\n, and Berk lost their [location at the Burlington Arcade](http://www.permanentstyle.co.uk/2013/09/get-the-last-ballantyne-cashmere-ever.html)\n (although, there are plans to [reopen online](http://www.berkcashmere.co.uk/)\n). Thankfully, whisky and tweed remain, but Scottish cashmere as an industry seems to hang by a thread.\n\nMy friend Reginald Jerome de Mans – who has written [some of the](http://asuitablewardrobe.blogspot.com/2013/05/another-obit.html)\n [best articles](http://asuitablewardrobe.blogspot.com/2014/01/skipping-in-burlington-arcade.html)\n on this subject – likes to tell me how good Scottish cashmere used to be, before its decline. Densely knitted from long hair yarns, such sweaters are said to not pill or lose shape easily. They were also not as soft – at least not straight of out the box. Instead, softness had to be beaten into them, like character into raw denim. Simon Crompton thinks the softness in modern sweaters is [a result of over-milling](http://www.permanentstyle.co.uk/2013/09/get-the-last-ballantyne-cashmere-ever.html)\n; Jesse at Put This On believes its from [shorter hairs in yarns](http://putthison.com/post/33160138133/old-cashmere-is-better-heres-the-honest-truth)\n; one manager I spoke to says its because such sweaters aren’t knit tightly enough. Whatever the reason, it seems most companies have sacrificed durability for a more luxurious hand.\n\nI was finally able to try one of these famed sweaters last year, when I bought a cable knit from [William Lockie](http://www.williamlockie.com/index.php)\n. It’s a world apart from any cashmere sweater I’ve ever owned. Certainly better than those I’ve bought from Italian and Chinese makers, but even better the ones from Scotland. The [Johnstons of Elgin](http://bit.ly/1L4Y5la)\n I picked up from Sierra Trading Post pilled easily, while a Barrie-made sweater stretched out after just a few wears. I don’t know if that’s because it was made from a two-ply yarn or because it was too loosely knitted. Either way, at the price Barrie commands, I wasn’t willing to try again.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e34ff2bf17ac27abc04c256375c859b7/tumblr_inline_pe157pRgeY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe William Lockie sweater, however, has been fantastic. It’s considerably more durable and only gets softer with each (hand) wash. I was so impressed with the one I bought last year that I recently picked up a few more.\n\nYou can find them online at William Lockie’s store, [Heather Wallace](http://www.heatherwallace.com/)\n. The smallest size for most models is 42” (meaning, that’s the actual measured chest size). If you need something smaller, like me, you’ll have to place a special order. Sweaters can be made with any of Lockie’s yarns, although their online swatches aren’t terribly helpful. For reference, pictured below are: navy, bottle, linen, mushroom, flannel, and derby. This [Melrose product page](http://www.heatherwallace.com/men_cashmere_detail.php?prod_ID=32)\n seems to list most of their colors, but you may want to search around the site for more. \n\nMr. Porter also carries the [Oxton model](http://bit.ly/1BRw9P6)\n, but again – it’s a single-ply and I don’t know if low-ply yarns are more likely to lose shape. If anyone were to get it right, however, I’d trust Lockie. The upside to single- and two-ply sweaters is that you layer them underneath sport coats. These [four-ply Chirnside knits](http://www.heatherwallace.com/men_cashmere_detail.php?prod_ID=35)\n are only good with outerwear.\n\nI have an interview with Allan Gilchrist from William Lockie going up at [Put This On](http://putthison.com/)\n at some point. As with everything published here (and there), I didn’t receive any special favors or discounts in exchange for the interview. I only interviewed them because I was so impressed with the sweaters I bought.

For casualwear, try treated cottons, heavily ribbed wools, and pebble grain leathers. \n\n_(photos via me, [Baby & Company](http://babyandco.us/products/aircraft-jacket-tan)\n, [Butch Blum](http://butchblum.blogspot.com/2012/12/inis-meain-alpacasilk-scarf.html)\n, [Chriscrat](http://chriscrat.tumblr.com/)\n, [End](http://www.endclothing.com/)\n, [A Kind of Guise](http://akindofguise.com/)\n, and [Ralph Lauren](http://bit.ly/15D0cvZ)\n)_\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/89fb09c2efe0bc1f45d9acf30790db13/tumblr_inline_peb3d1i6OG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b3b6599285e17b4eccbee45cce60b3a/tumblr_inline_peb3d2BpB01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8cc52f157b7372666c40df9031273bbc/tumblr_inline_peb3d2bpVT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/858dbd9aee5feb4840619e60a324e806/tumblr_inline_peb3d2R6hz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5ed03223b3594cb57a0a16b3a4bade00/tumblr_inline_peb3d2vlAj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ecab84400c2a08d61ac7321fcc82cf20/tumblr_inline_peb3d4yF4m1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f5dee80c5036dde3d034ff3d8f70f97/tumblr_inline_peb3d47BYF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce6d4ab6a0dc7c93681a15f48581801b/tumblr_inline_peb3d57QT31qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/67c10ca6e2af36d9abcae1ec7a3c4ad9/tumblr_inline_peb3d6jRv41qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8bbd0b7fa3c90eabe33e1a83e1d07d7f/tumblr_inline_peb3d7NLZM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a8897826b500e6c647aa9d1e0fb61fef/tumblr_inline_peb3d7gWQ61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ee8d8712d545024672635d10c3d212b6/tumblr_inline_peb3d8CBYm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4df0230c4ae92c74b6e518e337b96f27/tumblr_inline_peb3d8ol2C1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/846cbf24966c5b6f35c74f47e27642cf/tumblr_inline_peb3d9KYo01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7d4e895d647b248f6b445a3ab94401a/tumblr_inline_peb3da7f281qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dbf4773d34f7214daefe102f154a96e2/tumblr_inline_peb3db6JbH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Textured Cotton, Wool, and Leather — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Textured Cotton, Wool, and Leather — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"I’ve been enjoying some texture-heavy looks recently. The jacket above is this season’s modified Aircraft jacket from Nigel Cabourn.

A few years ago, I read about Simon Crompton’s [bespoke eyewear sleeve](http://www.permanentstyle.co.uk/2012/04/alfred-dunhill-bespoke-glasses-case.html)\n. Made by Alfred Dunhill, it was saddle stitched from green crocodile leather. I looked around for something similar, but everything was either too expensive or not nearly as handsome.\n\nA few months ago, however, when [Chester Mox](http://www.chestermox.com/)\n loaned me [some samples from their new line](https://dieworkwear.com/post/98980279924/new-standards)\n, it dawned on me that they’d be perfect company for this sort of thing. Bellanie – the co-founder of the company – recently graduated from an apprenticeship with a high-profile leatherworker. Her techniques before were good, but her new work is downright amazing. Best of all, her prices are exceptionally reasonable – considerably less than any luxury label of similar quality, and certainly much less than any bespoke producer.\n\nSo, I commissioned a custom, black alligator eyewear sleeve. The leather she used is great – supple and soft, it has the flexibility needed for this sort of case, as well as the clean, even scales that distinguishes a good hide from a bad one. From here, the process of making the sleeve is fairly simple and straightforward, but there’s also a lot to the technique.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ec73d7112493cb827298a0a1db1a885/tumblr_inline_pba104c5mb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/74967b702cb6569a5afa73f911ce81c3/tumblr_inline_pba105iJoR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe most important thing, of course, is to cut the leather in a way that helps the design. Bellanie cut just above the center of the hide, which allows some small scales to be at the non-opening side of the case, before then smoothly transitioning to bigger scales as you go up to the top. Think of it as a gradation effect.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed40b3078b44801dc2698b99986c0005/tumblr_inline_pba105mOyv1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fcaeb1a1a78afe24b45b56a83d1b407c/tumblr_inline_pba105GIAj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3069c1d45241e088f4e2290b2b9d39f/tumblr_inline_pba10640TP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nNext, [Alcantara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcantara_%28material%29)\n is attached to the backside, so as to make the interior soft enough for eyewear (Alcantara, incidentally, has thus far proven to be a lot better than my suede-interior cases, as my sunglasses slide in much more smoothly). The leather is then punched with an awl, in order to prepare it for [saddle stitching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fHYcnrSie8)\n. Such stitching is not only more durable than machine stitching, but it also gives that inimitable, slightly-angled stitching pattern that can only be produced by hand.\n\nFinally, once stitched, the edges are then burnished and painted in order to protect the leather and give it a more pleasing finish. From the side view, you can hardly tell where the two leathers meet.\n\nSo, three years after seeing Simon’s sleeve, I finally have mine. It’s slim enough to slip into a jacket pocket, but also protective enough to keep sharp objects from scratching my lenses.

It’s slowly shifted from large, luxury department stores, such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, to smaller and more specialized boutiques, such as [Self Edge](http://selfedge.com/)\n and [Leffot](http://leffot.com/)\n. Granted, any individual boutique will have smaller sales numbers than a larger operation, but few style enthusiasts I know shop at luxury chains anymore – even those as small as Barney’s. Everyone seems to prefer things that feel a bit more intimate, specialized, and niche. \n\nOne specialty store I’ve been particularly impressed with is [Skoaktiebolaget](http://www.skoaktiebolaget.se/)\n. A small, Scandinavian operation that focuses on footwear, it started only a few years ago in 2012. Still, in just three years, it’s managed to build an impressive roster of brands – Edward Green, Gaziano & Girling, Carmina, and Enzo Bonafè. No small feat, especially when you consider that Edward Green has been operating at full capacity for some time and is very selective about who they let carry their label.\n\nPatrik Löf, the shop’s owner, tells me that he picks brands based on what he loves, as well as what each brings to the table. Carmina offers the best bang-for-the-buck in the premium segment, while Edward Green has  \nsome of the most iconic styles around. Enzo Bonafè also gives uniquely good  \nvalue given their craftsmanship and flexible made-to-order program (which Patrik says gives “almost endless possibilities”). “They’re a  \nsmall family-owned company in Bologna,” he says. “They specialize in hand  \nwelted shoes, which the Italians sometimes mischaracterize as hand welted  \nGoodyear.” As readers know, short of going bespoke, it’s hard to find hand  \nwelted shoes these days – especially for less than $1,000. Most high-end shoes are  \nconstructed by machine – either with Goodyear welting or Blake stitching – even if  \nthey market themselves as “benchmade” or “handgrade.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4d6709d1756230e75b676862525cea92/tumblr_inline_pa26tsnmzv1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef7baeafb7b3ab8fdf3dde78645243a3/tumblr_inline_pa26tt6bTi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nSkoaktiebolaget has a small, carefully selected line of  \nready-made shoes from each label, but it’s their made-to-order service that  \nmakes them special. With a favorable exchange rate and tax discounts, you can get anything you want at a price lower than you’d find at most other  \nretailers. That includes a number of special make-ups, such as the small batch  \nof [Edward Green Dovers last year in Willow Calf](http://skoaktiebolaget.tumblr.com/post/103965701810/edward-green-oak-willow-calf-mto-edwardgreen)\n – a unique grained leather that  \nEdward Green used to offer many years ago, and only rediscovered recently in small  \nquantities (it’s no longer in stock, I’m told). Patrik also tells me he was particularly pleased with a “Frankenstitch” jumper boot from Carmina. “It was  \none of those styles I never looked twice at until a client had us make it in  \nburgundy shell cordovan.” At the moment, they even have a new [M-43 inspired boot from Edward Green](http://www.skoaktiebolaget.se/collections/frontpage/products/pre-order-deposit-edward-green-kentmere)\n as a special MTO. \n\nAs for his plans for expansion,  \nPatrik says he just secured a new storage space, so they’ll have more  \nready-made styles soon (and in greater quantities). “I don’t believe  \nin carrying too many brands, however.

It’s slowly shifted from large, luxury department stores, such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, to smaller and more specialized boutiques, such as [Self Edge](http://selfedge.com/)\n and [Leffot](http://leffot.com/)\n. Granted, any individual boutique will have smaller sales numbers than a larger operation, but few style enthusiasts I know shop at luxury chains anymore – even those as small as Barney’s. Everyone seems to prefer things that feel a bit more intimate, specialized, and niche. \n\nOne specialty store I’ve been particularly impressed with is [Skoaktiebolaget](http://www.skoaktiebolaget.se/)\n. A small, Scandinavian operation that focuses on footwear, it started only a few years ago in 2012. Still, in just three years, it’s managed to build an impressive roster of brands – Edward Green, Gaziano & Girling, Carmina, and Enzo Bonafè. No small feat, especially when you consider that Edward Green has been operating at full capacity for some time and is very selective about who they let carry their label.\n\nPatrik Löf, the shop’s owner, tells me that he picks brands based on what he loves, as well as what each brings to the table. Carmina offers the best bang-for-the-buck in the premium segment, while Edward Green has  \nsome of the most iconic styles around. Enzo Bonafè also gives uniquely good  \nvalue given their craftsmanship and flexible made-to-order program (which Patrik says gives “almost endless possibilities”). “They’re a  \nsmall family-owned company in Bologna,” he says. “They specialize in hand  \nwelted shoes, which the Italians sometimes mischaracterize as hand welted  \nGoodyear.” As readers know, short of going bespoke, it’s hard to find hand  \nwelted shoes these days – especially for less than $1,000. Most high-end shoes are  \nconstructed by machine – either with Goodyear welting or Blake stitching – even if  \nthey market themselves as “benchmade” or “handgrade.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4d6709d1756230e75b676862525cea92/tumblr_inline_pa26tsnmzv1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef7baeafb7b3ab8fdf3dde78645243a3/tumblr_inline_pa26tt6bTi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nSkoaktiebolaget has a small, carefully selected line of  \nready-made shoes from each label, but it’s their made-to-order service that  \nmakes them special. With a favorable exchange rate and tax discounts, you can get anything you want at a price lower than you’d find at most other  \nretailers. That includes a number of special make-ups, such as the small batch  \nof [Edward Green Dovers last year in Willow Calf](http://skoaktiebolaget.tumblr.com/post/103965701810/edward-green-oak-willow-calf-mto-edwardgreen)\n – a unique grained leather that  \nEdward Green used to offer many years ago, and only rediscovered recently in small  \nquantities (it’s no longer in stock, I’m told). Patrik also tells me he was particularly pleased with a “Frankenstitch” jumper boot from Carmina. “It was  \none of those styles I never looked twice at until a client had us make it in  \nburgundy shell cordovan.” At the moment, they even have a new [M-43 inspired boot from Edward Green](http://www.skoaktiebolaget.se/collections/frontpage/products/pre-order-deposit-edward-green-kentmere)\n as a special MTO. \n\nAs for his plans for expansion,  \nPatrik says he just secured a new storage space, so they’ll have more  \nready-made styles soon (and in greater quantities). “I don’t believe  \nin carrying too many brands, however. We’re specialists, and if we bring in too  \nmany brands, it’s hard to maintain an expert level of knowledge for each  \nlabel.”\n\nThere is one downside to ordering from Skoaktiebolaget –  \nwhen people ask where you bought your shoes, you have no idea how to say the company’s  \nname. When I asked Patrik how to pronounce Skoaktiebolaget, he laughed. “Come  \nto Stockholm. We’ll have some vodka, talk about shoes, and I will teach you.” \n\nOh well, if you’re worried about butchering the name, like me, you can always say “a specialty shop in Sweden.\" \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71dd06b01408da5d87f81e15c2d26d43/tumblr_inline_pa26ttINU31qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/816fad14d9a5073066f3dbb3ebaa4314/tumblr_inline_pa26ttIS071qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5640807faedff1525e263832c8feef5/tumblr_inline_pa26tu67Fy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfccbc2c1ac218588d46867f0de8bc77/tumblr_inline_pa26tuRVqC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b18186a2f706bd398a209d4987944755/tumblr_inline_pa26tueh2P1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b716084c168a44a5a33906985c66ca60/tumblr_inline_pa26tvaN2U1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/847145ddf9ad2c1b4033c5c8a1935ca7/tumblr_inline_pa26tv4UBc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/91c9f27361734cfdd70ecbfcc7173e55/tumblr_inline_pa26tvWOwI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4eda27c30622cfbf51864b59d6cd0764/tumblr_inline_pa26twP93W1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5defa1316847e57dae853d45249e85dd/tumblr_inline_pa26twUNAo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/af5ca265278d9e3d440bb94b04bc56c9/tumblr_inline_pa26tw8Q1O1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/67abba015a02ad5bdf2fcd6fcb19c340/tumblr_inline_pa26txQq8s1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3ff872d7195ba18a2b04177f1bf6a70/tumblr_inline_pa26txMk7b1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c70ee921208a4a6d92ead7a68c132fac/tumblr_inline_pa26tyQt761qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e57db105d59aeab53874e7b4f74f5b1/tumblr_inline_pa26tzeK2W1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d6539181932928311b104e7106480fc/tumblr_inline_pa26u0WfH81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/258b205baafe02cbbca40df0bbdbe350/tumblr_inline_pa26u0jqOf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09224deec34d18735e259353467cdcde/tumblr_inline_pa26u1M7RD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/89e78c6e400d03a1d35af4fa6a46aa5f/tumblr_inline_pa26u16Aau1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cd7beeee495209a1c8a7dbf32eccd7f3/tumblr_inline_pa26u1K5Vt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa95fe57a676d673b44a7c70df7186f5/tumblr_inline_pa26u2WAzt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/70ebb6d40e8868f47ed2c0821b00c7df/tumblr_inline_pa26u2BK6q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/183e7dd5ae776781f1d546fc8961bd12/tumblr_inline_pa26u2NReL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b18110249b318aee651cd5b7e865fdc/tumblr_inline_pa26u22ENa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d01fce7b6deeaae2f534d98c0ae4b4b/tumblr_inline_pa26u3lr0H1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5f8f526ce9482ba229a1958037d70cbe/tumblr_inline_pa26u3FVnS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b89408bb05d8f3bb94155b6a6685f439/tumblr_inline_pa26u3bmCR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/15e8b4dc6d0fe3f27d87f57768faca38/tumblr_inline_pa26u4rMPP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/571b4ea06f98a6ea1903ea0736e75b65/tumblr_inline_pa26u4Lw1S1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d0452adc26eb6aef594fb1a5cb3da80c/tumblr_inline_pa26u4cFav1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3096cde6b59b514d8a276ae65b90ce8/tumblr_inline_pa26u5MUaV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fb380b5bd7ff9a5ee351a41192977ef6/tumblr_inline_pa26u5fRqe1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/17fe00134d99fbc5182734ff3cfae6a7/tumblr_inline_pa26u5TAAK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f28315616a74fbeb51b7d12bda06affe/tumblr_inline_pa26u6RGwm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"A Specialty Shop in Sweden — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"A Specialty Shop in Sweden — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"The landscape for high-end men’s clothing has changed a lot in the last hundred years.

The popular English label continues to design some of the best men’s accessories I’ve seen anywhere. Michael Hill, the company’s Creative Director, tells me that they’ve relied a lot on interesting and subtle weaves this season. “We have a linen chambray from Solbiati,” he says. “It has a nice texture and a bit more color than plain weave linens. There will also be some semi-warp faced cloths, which have a nice, antique hand, as well as a lot of slubby silks.\" \n\nMy favorites so far are the [grenadines](http://www.drakes.com/online-shop/ties/grenadine)\n and [pocket squares](http://www.drakes.com/online-shop/pocket-squares)\n. Drake’s grenadines now come in two weaves – larger and smaller versions known as _garza grossa_ and _garza fina_, respectively. They also have grenadines with striped, dotted, and jacquard patterns, for those who want something a little more distinctive ([these](http://www.drakes.com/online-shop/ties/grenadine/handrolled-woven-grenadine-8cm-silk-tie)\n [look](http://www.drakes.com/online-shop/ties/grenadine/handrolled-woven-grenadine-8cm-silk-tie-8395)\n particularly good). For pocket squares, there are cotton bandana prints, as well as a number of interesting designs on silk habotai – an exceptionally lightweight, slightly sheer, plain weave silk that has a bit of sheen.

The popular English label continues to design some of the best men’s accessories I’ve seen anywhere. Michael Hill, the company’s Creative Director, tells me that they’ve relied a lot on interesting and subtle weaves this season. “We have a linen chambray from Solbiati,” he says. “It has a nice texture and a bit more color than plain weave linens. There will also be some semi-warp faced cloths, which have a nice, antique hand, as well as a lot of slubby silks.\" \n\nMy favorites so far are the [grenadines](http://www.drakes.com/online-shop/ties/grenadine)\n and [pocket squares](http://www.drakes.com/online-shop/pocket-squares)\n. Drake’s grenadines now come in two weaves – larger and smaller versions known as _garza grossa_ and _garza fina_, respectively. They also have grenadines with striped, dotted, and jacquard patterns, for those who want something a little more distinctive ([these](http://www.drakes.com/online-shop/ties/grenadine/handrolled-woven-grenadine-8cm-silk-tie)\n [look](http://www.drakes.com/online-shop/ties/grenadine/handrolled-woven-grenadine-8cm-silk-tie-8395)\n particularly good). For pocket squares, there are cotton bandana prints, as well as a number of interesting designs on silk habotai – an exceptionally lightweight, slightly sheer, plain weave silk that has a bit of sheen. I find it goes well with cotton and linen jacketings. \n\nMichael also tells me they have some sport coats, shirts, and chinos coming. \"We’ve never thought about design in terms of a product alone,” he says. “It’s always been about a look as a whole, so in some ways, this is a natural extension for us. It’s taken a bit of work to learn how to construct these other things, but I feel we’ve done a good job.\" \n\nYou can see some of the new items at [Drake’s website](http://www.drakes.com/)\n (which I’m told will be revamped soon).

One of my tailors, [Steed](http://www.steed.co.uk/)\n, is famous for their natural shoulder line. When they were in town this weekend as part of [their US tour](http://www.steed.co.uk/en/travel-itinerary/)\n, I stopped by to chat about my next commission. During our conversation, they were nice enough to show me what goes into their shoulder construction. \n\nAs many readers know, Edwin DeBoise worked for [Edward Sexton](http://www.edwardsexton.co.uk/)\n (of Tommy Nutter fame) and [Anderson & Sheppard](http://www.anderson-sheppard.co.uk/)\n before starting his own tailoring house. His current style is quite close to the Anderson & Sheppard drape cut — a bit of fullness in the chest with a nipped waist, close skirt, and soft shoulder. Despite all the shaping, there’s actually very little padding inside their coats, as you can see above.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/db09af4a56fca578d0caa552311e8173/tumblr_inline_p7k6ftrCIj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nHere you can see the different layers that go into the shoulder. The very top is the lining and underneath that is the shoulder pad. The black material is demett — a soft, felt-like fabric that extends into the sleeve head. It sits on top of the horsehair and body canvas, partly to protect the wearer from the rough horsehair below (the stuff can be a bit prickly). Finally, the bottommost layer is the jacketing, which in this case is a cream herringbone tweed. Baste stitching holds everything together. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bf000dc9e99a32f1e660edf4a587ff5b/tumblr_inline_p7k6fuVi161qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/774e1983587f968c198770ad1295eaf3/tumblr_inline_p7k6fveWoZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nYou can get a better sense of the thickness of the shoulder pads here, in these two photos [David Isle took for StyleForum](http://www.styleforum.net/t/361877/my-visit-to-steed-tailors/0_20)\n (these were taken at Steed’s workshop in Cumbria). Unlike most tailoring houses — including those on Savile Row — Steed doesn’t use ready-made pads. Instead, they make their own from cotton wadding. This allows them to control the thickness and shaping better when they’re adjusting something on a client. \n\nIn fact, I originally went in on Sunday to see if they could add a little more padding to my right shoulder. Most men have a dropped shoulder that corresponds with their dominant hand, but mine is especially dropped. Since Steed makes their own pads, they’ll be able to adjust the thickness to hide the defect (as much as it can be hidden, anyway), while also giving the illusion of a natural shoulder. As Edwin put it, you don’t want to overdo it, otherwise it’ll both look and feel awkward. \n\nBelow you can see some variations of Steed’s shoulder constructions.

One of my tailors, [Steed](http://www.steed.co.uk/)\n, is famous for their natural shoulder line. When they were in town this weekend as part of [their US tour](http://www.steed.co.uk/en/travel-itinerary/)\n, I stopped by to chat about my next commission. During our conversation, they were nice enough to show me what goes into their shoulder construction. \n\nAs many readers know, Edwin DeBoise worked for [Edward Sexton](http://www.edwardsexton.co.uk/)\n (of Tommy Nutter fame) and [Anderson & Sheppard](http://www.anderson-sheppard.co.uk/)\n before starting his own tailoring house. His current style is quite close to the Anderson & Sheppard drape cut — a bit of fullness in the chest with a nipped waist, close skirt, and soft shoulder. Despite all the shaping, there’s actually very little padding inside their coats, as you can see above.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/db09af4a56fca578d0caa552311e8173/tumblr_inline_p7k6ftrCIj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nHere you can see the different layers that go into the shoulder. The very top is the lining and underneath that is the shoulder pad. The black material is demett — a soft, felt-like fabric that extends into the sleeve head. It sits on top of the horsehair and body canvas, partly to protect the wearer from the rough horsehair below (the stuff can be a bit prickly). Finally, the bottommost layer is the jacketing, which in this case is a cream herringbone tweed. Baste stitching holds everything together. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bf000dc9e99a32f1e660edf4a587ff5b/tumblr_inline_p7k6fuVi161qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/774e1983587f968c198770ad1295eaf3/tumblr_inline_p7k6fveWoZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nYou can get a better sense of the thickness of the shoulder pads here, in these two photos [David Isle took for StyleForum](http://www.styleforum.net/t/361877/my-visit-to-steed-tailors/0_20)\n (these were taken at Steed’s workshop in Cumbria). Unlike most tailoring houses — including those on Savile Row — Steed doesn’t use ready-made pads. Instead, they make their own from cotton wadding. This allows them to control the thickness and shaping better when they’re adjusting something on a client. \n\nIn fact, I originally went in on Sunday to see if they could add a little more padding to my right shoulder. Most men have a dropped shoulder that corresponds with their dominant hand, but mine is especially dropped. Since Steed makes their own pads, they’ll be able to adjust the thickness to hide the defect (as much as it can be hidden, anyway), while also giving the illusion of a natural shoulder. As Edwin put it, you don’t want to overdo it, otherwise it’ll both look and feel awkward. \n\nBelow you can see some variations of Steed’s shoulder constructions.

When [I saw Will from A Suitable Wardrobe](https://dieworkwear.com/post/104767432674/behind-a-suitable-wardrobe)\n two months ago, he was wearing something similar to what’s seen in the first image below. His brown glen plaid suit had a faint blue overcheck, and it was paired with some [brown suede loafers](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/shoes/shoes-137/tasseled-slipons)\n and a [grey cashmere rollneck](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/clothing/knitwear/cashmere-rollneck-pullover)\n. The combination looked so good that I’ve been eyeing the (more affordable) [Geelong version by William Lockie](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/clothing/knitwear/rollneck-pullovers)\n ever since.\n\nThe word classic is so abused these days, but it’s nice to see that some style advice from eighty years ago is still useful today. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5ffdcde8d9c18b33b61efd9cdd218416/tumblr_inline_p8nsw4FMFk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe2603955e42607dc8816bc415c63876/tumblr_inline_p8nsw4bFzY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73e03c17a48b046bec666f87e183b57e/tumblr_inline_p8nsw4M7qZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3dd3477fccc64c4de86c2ff048601ee/tumblr_inline_p8nsw5Pt201qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71dcd08f4a97cb5318cf79a1753a0c5f/tumblr_inline_p8nsw5zy481qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/35d7524e3a59d73c4945472828c91359/tumblr_inline_p8nsw5Ozqy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f7f3698fdccbd3fe5ee3fe8979119bfb/tumblr_inline_p8nsw6r8XQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/109a2941ce212230d03dbdd313f28c6a/tumblr_inline_p8nsw6J9FP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2e4658e361a7f1e405d4ac1b25a0f973/tumblr_inline_p8nsw75Zkg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f05567c920bfcd6ab799ab84500f624/tumblr_inline_p8nswhw6Wc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2269aebf09554e71bb9ca105c19f82ea/tumblr_inline_p8nswiS1Wi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c035caee06abe9b8883c83695dc5fa7/tumblr_inline_p8nswiFxy61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd80a754b5e40be4dc2bf2079a56b115/tumblr_inline_p8nswiyYUK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/538998dc7218356e3457f2a36010ef44/tumblr_inline_p8nswjqrJg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1422e130e2a8f7e29f8c2eafdd61f125/tumblr_inline_p8nswj9j6O1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce63c49573c62cfeb4281757243e65ea/tumblr_inline_p8nswjPvSl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b968af0d3e72991ba16669604f2f948/tumblr_inline_p8nswk0GPe1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/be7da16e09829aac3989dbc0f3cad898/tumblr_inline_p8nswkfJ5a1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7606d7ae94e7fc9eeaf254446f453a7b/tumblr_inline_p8nswlwtzQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/99d4f14ba9714e666cadff45d638ec4f/tumblr_inline_p8nswlQbij1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7faff38b37d90ebe8559b4d35b1cb7d/tumblr_inline_p8nswl4fFP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1d48daba48c5debd83c700b3109258d6/tumblr_inline_p8nswmZVjO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c8d00712e354b24536568cec539c0bf/tumblr_inline_p8nswmxJRD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e96c17716f6065f68170f2a8df9f591/tumblr_inline_p8nswnn9DF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e404d448c048840546a86dc5b440cba/tumblr_inline_p8nswnzfUn1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3e46f92d8b533bad8d71aad29a0b76ba/tumblr_inline_p8nswnvqgM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a6038034ac4358a03af5bb8312334fbb/tumblr_inline_p8nswoYL9K1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d964d39b689110347adce9f89613113/tumblr_inline_p8nswonmBc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73b937c7a96dbff129350cf179352b13/tumblr_inline_p8nswpct2h1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/db421c2df2307eee1d31ca61febd4e59/tumblr_inline_p8nswq1dmj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/08532e914d25a1ae620669a6a48661e5/tumblr_inline_p8nswq1Ylt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff822e3d6c931aa50a9f1160b9262f72/tumblr_inline_p8nswr4rul1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c36a041d6c7c2784d7b8b6c4ddb2709/tumblr_inline_p8nswu0c691qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b89c9e57b69de7996c2d7078d1207753/tumblr_inline_p8nswvdvgN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a09acedc11922bd776b821b37e8761f8/tumblr_inline_p8nswvyVY61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e13ac3f8ae2d1f6ff3bfcaeb2fd9085d/tumblr_inline_p8nswvpTkN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7bf167d1034416a891a48b6aba548eea/tumblr_inline_p8nswwHWtR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b22eb314ef94e05f2ea9e03ecca2e291/tumblr_inline_p8nswwP8sd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4764e7f6170edad1e7b9d0f8c7fbf00c/tumblr_inline_p8nswxxtGU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/419665dbfd51eb6b520d88407ee2e9c5/tumblr_inline_p8nswx451d1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/32b9e3bee8fe5b6d0aae92cc716eccaa/tumblr_inline_p8nswyI5ZS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/96d02e3c4186ca382a04adfd11642e77/tumblr_inline_p8nswyUlDN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/725c668490e6624613197ce94158f7fe/tumblr_inline_p8nswyu2ve1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71d6647f7d36bf6d6dfe790133699308/tumblr_inline_p8n

When [I saw Will from A Suitable Wardrobe](https://dieworkwear.com/post/104767432674/behind-a-suitable-wardrobe)\n two months ago, he was wearing something similar to what’s seen in the first image below. His brown glen plaid suit had a faint blue overcheck, and it was paired with some [brown suede loafers](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/shoes/shoes-137/tasseled-slipons)\n and a [grey cashmere rollneck](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/clothing/knitwear/cashmere-rollneck-pullover)\n. The combination looked so good that I’ve been eyeing the (more affordable) [Geelong version by William Lockie](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/clothing/knitwear/rollneck-pullovers)\n ever since.\n\nThe word classic is so abused these days, but it’s nice to see that some style advice from eighty years ago is still useful today. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5ffdcde8d9c18b33b61efd9cdd218416/tumblr_inline_p8nsw4FMFk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe2603955e42607dc8816bc415c63876/tumblr_inline_p8nsw4bFzY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73e03c17a48b046bec666f87e183b57e/tumblr_inline_p8nsw4M7qZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3dd3477fccc64c4de86c2ff048601ee/tumblr_inline_p8nsw5Pt201qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71dcd08f4a97cb5318cf79a1753a0c5f/tumblr_inline_p8nsw5zy481qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/35d7524e3a59d73c4945472828c91359/tumblr_inline_p8nsw5Ozqy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f7f3698fdccbd3fe5ee3fe8979119bfb/tumblr_inline_p8nsw6r8XQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/109a2941ce212230d03dbdd313f28c6a/tumblr_inline_p8nsw6J9FP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2e4658e361a7f1e405d4ac1b25a0f973/tumblr_inline_p8nsw75Zkg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f05567c920bfcd6ab799ab84500f624/tumblr_inline_p8nswhw6Wc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2269aebf09554e71bb9ca105c19f82ea/tumblr_inline_p8nswiS1Wi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c035caee06abe9b8883c83695dc5fa7/tumblr_inline_p8nswiFxy61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd80a754b5e40be4dc2bf2079a56b115/tumblr_inline_p8nswiyYUK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/538998dc7218356e3457f2a36010ef44/tumblr_inline_p8nswjqrJg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1422e130e2a8f7e29f8c2eafdd61f125/tumblr_inline_p8nswj9j6O1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce63c49573c62cfeb4281757243e65ea/tumblr_inline_p8nswjPvSl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b968af0d3e72991ba16669604f2f948/tumblr_inline_p8nswk0GPe1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/be7da16e09829aac3989dbc0f3cad898/tumblr_inline_p8nswkfJ5a1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7606d7ae94e7fc9eeaf254446f453a7b/tumblr_inline_p8nswlwtzQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/99d4f14ba9714e666cadff45d638ec4f/tumblr_inline_p8nswlQbij1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7faff38b37d90ebe8559b4d35b1cb7d/tumblr_inline_p8nswl4fFP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1d48daba48c5debd83c700b3109258d6/tumblr_inline_p8nswmZVjO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c8d00712e354b24536568cec539c0bf/tumblr_inline_p8nswmxJRD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e96c17716f6065f68170f2a8df9f591/tumblr_inline_p8nswnn9DF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e404d448c048840546a86dc5b440cba/tumblr_inline_p8nswnzfUn1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3e46f92d8b533bad8d71aad29a0b76ba/tumblr_inline_p8nswnvqgM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a6038034ac4358a03af5bb8312334fbb/tumblr_inline_p8nswoYL9K1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d964d39b689110347adce9f89613113/tumblr_inline_p8nswonmBc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73b937c7a96dbff129350cf179352b13/tumblr_inline_p8nswpct2h1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/db421c2df2307eee1d31ca61febd4e59/tumblr_inline_p8nswq1dmj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/08532e914d25a1ae620669a6a48661e5/tumblr_inline_p8nswq1Ylt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff822e3d6c931aa50a9f1160b9262f72/tumblr_inline_p8nswr4rul1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c36a041d6c7c2784d7b8b6c4ddb2709/tumblr_inline_p8nswu0c691qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b89c9e57b69de7996c2d7078d1207753/tumblr_inline_p8nswvdvgN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a09acedc11922bd776b821b37e8761f8/tumblr_inline_p8nswvyVY61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e13ac3f8ae2d1f6ff3bfcaeb2fd9085d/tumblr_inline_p8nswvpTkN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7bf167d1034416a891a48b6aba548eea/tumblr_inline_p8nswwHWtR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b22eb314ef94e05f2ea9e03ecca2e291/tumblr_inline_p8nswwP8sd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4764e7f6170edad1e7b9d0f8c7fbf00c/tumblr_inline_p8nswxxtGU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/419665dbfd51eb6b520d88407ee2e9c5/tumblr_inline_p8nswx451d1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/32b9e3bee8fe5b6d0aae92cc716eccaa/tumblr_inline_p8nswyI5ZS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/96d02e3c4186ca382a04adfd11642e77/tumblr_inline_p8nswyUlDN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/725c668490e6624613197ce94158f7fe/tumblr_inline_p8nswyu2ve1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71d6647f7d36bf6d6dfe790133699308/tumblr_inline_p8n

Tailoring is often thought of as being above the frays of fashion, but this oversimplifies the history of suits and misses what’s often exciting about designer clothing. Not all fashion is about trends, even if all trends are about fashion. Just check out the [Metropolitan Museum of Art’s exhibit on Alexander McQueen](http://blog.metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen/)\n, for example. It’s hard to not get swept away.\n\nFew fashion designers capture imagination as well as those that came out of Japan in the 1970s and ‘80s. Designers such as Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto, and Rei Kawakubo pioneered what can be described as a sort of “Japanese avant-garde.” Although, don’t use that term in public – not just because I made it up, but because all three have said that they resent being pigeonholed by their ethnicity. Miyake and Yamamoto have said that they see themselves more as being part of a “lost generation” – one that grew up on Western culture in Japan, but neither identifies with the West nor the East. Similarly, in an interview in Women’s Wear Daily, Kawakubo said she dislikes being pegged as a “Japanese designer,” while Miyake has noted that he’s trying to create “a new fashion genre that’s neither Japanese nor Western.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2e8534668592b6049830bdc7a3ed27a2/tumblr_inline_p7gsx3ooV21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nIf we don’t call their work Japanese, then it’s at least avant-garde. Their collections heavily rely on varying shades of black, but what feels like a restraint in color is offset by freer interpretations on the modern silhouette. Their asymmetric, deconstructed, and artfully ripped clothes often use holes and other forms of empty space as decoration. This departs from traditional Western modes of patternmaking, which tends to emphasize the human form. For women, that means accentuating a curvaceous bust and hips, but also narrowing the waist. These Japanese designers, on the other hand, seem to shroud the body rather than reveal it. Their work refuses to sexualize the female body, thus challenging conventional notions of gender in dress. \n\nIn [Future Beauty](http://amzn.to/1AXsldQ)\n, Akiko Fukai et al. wrote of these collections:\n\n“Kawakubo and Yamamoto’s offerings may have been thoughtlessly dubbed the ‘beggar look,’ but the so-called black rags were calculated in their design – the expression of an aesthetic at ease with untidiness and imperfection. Fashion during the early 1980s, arguably led by French designer Yves Saint Laurent, was all about color, and plenty of it. The Japanese designers, however, deliberately avoided vivid colors and made heavy use of monochromatic palette, from strong and varied hues of black to the simplicity and crispness of shades of white. Henceforth, Japanese fashion was not only perceived as unstructured and disheveled, it also became synonymous with the color black and start, monochrome minimalism.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d0d106f1856eb723c101893ca815ee8e/tumblr_inline_p7gsx4PGga1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2eebc5925b4d810c9babc753c719a3ba/tumblr_inline_p7gsx4RjdN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/241ca717ea1c1f47ae0b089510e7b2a8/tumblr_inline_p7gsx5UzrW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nInnovation here wasn’t just limited to color and design. There was also the production process. In 1999, Miyake launch his famous “A-POC” collection (a term coined from the phrase “A Piece of Cloth,” but was also a play on the word “epoch”). This collection featured a range of tubular knitwear that was produced on specially adapted Raschel knitting machines. Made without any machine-sewn seams and finished on a roll, they could be unfurled and – with the garments stitched into the tube – be cut free. A-POC was not only a clever way to approach production, but also represented a new way to think about design and wearability.\n\nGranted, not all of these are wearable, and at the end of the day – for better or worse – fashion is constrained by practical, social requirements (more so for men than women). In a recent article about Kanye’s latest fashion show, Robin Givan wrote in [The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2015/02/13/nyfw-what-kanye-west-gets-right-about-fashion-and-what-he-gets-wrong/)\n: \"Creativity is hard to come by in the fashion industry — perhaps harder than in almost any other creative field. Because when something daring and mesmerizing bubbles up in fashion, it can’t just be framed and hung on a wall, it isn’t just the soundtrack to your life; it is the cocoon in which you live, it’s your calling card. Fear isn’t the hurdle facing fashion. The human body is.”\n\nPractical considerations aside, for anyone who has ever appreciated the artful cutting and technical complexity behind a bespoke suit, it’s hard to not also appreciate the beauty behind these garments. Sometimes it takes something truly avant-garde to break your mind free from the tired “style vs. fashion” or “tailor vs. designer” dichotomies. \n\n_(Pictures via [Future Beauty](http://amzn.to/1AXsldQ)\n)_\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a3417d4d24edc006a4d41e195b26dc8/tumblr_inline_p7gsx58DWK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d60f25623abf231e6024e4386eaa3948/tumblr_inline_p7gsx6nXxC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/598e5a1b5a531a523e2b450c0e6c13fe/tumblr_inline_p7gsx7lHc11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d31618eb0e87862566405d0f311e0c3/tumblr_inline_p7gsx725SH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73ccd39238d2d1fa844f261beab0708d/tumblr_inline_p7gsx8SvGd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d37b65fc1ccb9cc0dbf1610b71cb408/tumblr_inline_p7gsx87AGO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bcb39fcb6e5a71ed14010025ee6d0899/tumblr_inline_p7gsx9UPpI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/25c85cadd40b98dce665b827b01f9b4f/tumblr_inline_p7gsx90ZsU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b60e674d7589ef77d88eb69951e3c0a/tumblr_inline_p7gsx9PiEb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/db3e78dcac5c8ea1ace433b5aa4ad662/tumblr_inline_p7gsxasw471qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/750f539cd662a652938ef902f0e8799d/tumblr_inline_p7gsxakhXt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b87ed40956069a511a5fa7a3e97f4c77/tumblr_inline_p7gsxbefKR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73186fd92453ca79578146820e741d27/tumblr_inline_p7gsxbGL7q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/57409efdce3e407c82fda2d326be11df/tumblr_inline_p7gsxcwUqo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/89c5bac965553a6ab2d54beaf9a817bd/tumblr_inline_p7gsxcuJtZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5a4d65115127b3cdd7dbb95376fa7321/tumblr_inline_p7gsxcTvPY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/517d6f5c020f63d09a0c5c4ed9c1adba/tumblr_inline_p7gsxdOEDd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e0c8fb089d1cf8b0e9e4a8fe5a02a697/tumblr_inline_p7gsxdFPt01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/417f24cef649d5ab9a05e5a00586b767/tumblr_inline_p7gsxe5ERL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f33609a101cf99f477c807bdd45ead08/tumblr_inline_p7gsxeimsJ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fab9bc5ff1ebc06334ac81d821017fff/tumblr_inline_p7gsxfnacL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce716ef115299858bde649d55c29a5d5/tumblr_inline_p7gsxfZJDR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/946e5f410bbd22436736ec1eb9a56fa0/tumblr_inline_p7gsx33FfK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nFashion is a dirty word among tailored clothing enthusiasts.

Henceforth, Japanese fashion was not only perceived as unstructured and disheveled, it also became synonymous with the color black and start, monochrome minimalism.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d0d106f1856eb723c101893ca815ee8e/tumblr_inline_p7gsx4PGga1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2eebc5925b4d810c9babc753c719a3ba/tumblr_inline_p7gsx4RjdN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/241ca717ea1c1f47ae0b089510e7b2a8/tumblr_inline_p7gsx5UzrW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nInnovation here wasn’t just limited to color and design. There was also the production process. In 1999, Miyake launch his famous “A-POC” collection (a term coined from the phrase “A Piece of Cloth,” but was also a play on the word “epoch”). This collection featured a range of tubular knitwear that was produced on specially adapted Raschel knitting machines. Made without any machine-sewn seams and finished on a roll, they could be unfurled and – with the garments stitched into the tube – be cut free. A-POC was not only a clever way to approach production, but also represented a new way to think about design and wearability.\n\nGranted, not all of these are wearable, and at the end of the day – for better or worse – fashion is constrained by practical, social requirements (more so for men than women). In a recent article about Kanye’s latest fashion show, Robin Givan wrote in [The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2015/02/13/nyfw-what-kanye-west-gets-right-about-fashion-and-what-he-gets-wrong/)\n: \"Creativity is hard to come by in the fashion industry — perhaps harder than in almost any other creative field. Because when something daring and mesmerizing bubbles up in fashion, it can’t just be framed and hung on a wall, it isn’t just the soundtrack to your life; it is the cocoon in which you live, it’s your calling card. Fear isn’t the hurdle facing fashion. The human body is.”\n\nPractical considerations aside, for anyone who has ever appreciated the artful cutting and technical complexity behind a bespoke suit, it’s hard to not also appreciate the beauty behind these garments. Sometimes it takes something truly avant-garde to break your mind free from the tired “style vs. fashion” or “tailor vs. designer” dichotomies. \n\n_(Pictures via [Future Beauty](http://amzn.to/1AXsldQ)\n)_\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a3417d4d24edc006a4d41e195b26dc8/tumblr_inline_p7gsx58DWK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d60f25623abf231e6024e4386eaa3948/tumblr_inline_p7gsx6nXxC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/598e5a1b5a531a523e2b450c0e6c13fe/tumblr_inline_p7gsx7lHc11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d31618eb0e87862566405d0f311e0c3/tumblr_inline_p7gsx725SH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73ccd39238d2d1fa844f261beab0708d/tumblr_inline_p7gsx8SvGd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d37b65fc1ccb9cc0dbf1610b71cb408/tumblr_inline_p7gsx87AGO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bcb39fcb6e5a71ed14010025ee6d0899/tumblr_inline_p7gsx9UPpI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/25c85cadd40b98dce665b827b01f9b4f/tumblr_inline_p7gsx90ZsU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b60e674d7589ef77d88eb69951e3c0a/tumblr_inline_p7gsx9PiEb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/db3e78dcac5c8ea1ace433b5aa4ad662/tumblr_inline_p7gsxasw471qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/750f539cd662a652938ef902f0e8799d/tumblr_inline_p7gsxakhXt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b87ed40956069a511a5fa7a3e97f4c77/tumblr_inline_p7gsxbefKR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73186fd92453ca79578146820e741d27/tumblr_inline_p7gsxbGL7q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/57409efdce3e407c82fda2d326be11df/tumblr_inline_p7gsxcwUqo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/89c5bac965553a6ab2d54beaf9a817bd/tumblr_inline_p7gsxcuJtZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5a4d65115127b3cdd7dbb95376fa7321/tumblr_inline_p7gsxcTvPY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/517d6f5c020f63d09a0c5c4ed9c1adba/tumblr_inline_p7gsxdOEDd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e0c8fb089d1cf8b0e9e4a8fe5a02a697/tumblr_inline_p7gsxdFPt01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/417f24cef649d5ab9a05e5a00586b767/tumblr_inline_p7gsxe5ERL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f33609a101cf99f477c807bdd45ead08/tumblr_inline_p7gsxeimsJ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fab9bc5ff1ebc06334ac81d821017fff/tumblr_inline_p7gsxfnacL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce716ef115299858bde649d55c29a5d5/tumblr_inline_p7gsxfZJDR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"The Japanse Avant-Garde — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"The Japanse Avant-Garde — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Fashion is a dirty word among tailored clothing enthusiasts.

The market there is booming, thanks to China’s economic growth, but consumers are said to be “unsophisticated.” Most buy luxury goods as status symbols, rather than for the quality they offer. As a person who’s half-Chinese, it’s hard to not get defensive over these characterizations, but it’s also hard to pretend they aren’t true.\n\nThere are some exceptions, however. George Wang – better known to some as [maomao](http://www.styleforum.net/u/2770/maomao1980)\n on StyleForum and [Beijing1980](http://beijing1980.tumblr.com/)\n on Tumblr – recently opened a menswear boutique in Beijing. Named BRIO, which is Italian for spirit or verve, it offers the kind of classic, softly tailored Italian style that George has always championed. George was in San Francisco last week, so we met at [La Farina](http://www.farina-foods.com/intro.php?url=restaurants)\n for lunch and chatted about his new store.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e97364444b071106a869d156afab1d6/tumblr_inline_para0b9Qfa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nBRIO is an impressive two stories. The first floor, which is street level, holds all of the shop’s menswear offerings. The second floor is downstairs, where you can find a lounge as well as a barbershop (BRIO has an in-house barber who can give a shave and a cut). The idea is make a space where men can hang out, relax, and have a drink; not just buy clothes. Photos show that the lounge is still a work-in-progress, but the space so far looks exceptionally nice.\n\nSo does the list of brands. There are some British makers, such as [Begg](http://www.beggandcompany.com/)\n, [Edward Green](http://www.edwardgreen.com/)\n, and [Sanders](http://www.sanders-uk.com/)\n (BRIO will be carrying Sanders’ Playboy chukkas, which were [made famous by Steve McQueen](http://www.acontinuouslean.com/2013/11/21/other-playboy/)\n). The rest, however, is largely Italian. The store will have [Sartoria Dalcuore](http://www.sartoriadalcuore.com/en/)\n for suits, [Stefano Bemer](http://www.stefanobemersrl.com/)\n for shoes, [Rota](http://www.rotasrl.com/en/index.htm)\n for trousers, and [G.

Whereas most places offer made-to-measure suits from the same mass-production factories, Sartoria Dalcuore will offer handmade, bespoke tailoring. To be successful, BRIO will need to draw in a certain kind of customer – one that understands the difference between ready-to-wear, made-to-measure, and bespoke – but George thinks the potential is there.\n\nUnfortunately, BRIO can’t take international orders at the moment. China’s customs and duties are simply too high, which makes it hard to export things out again. George didn’t rule out the possibility, however. Should the store work out, he can see setting up an outpost in Hong Kong at some point, where international shipping can take place.\n\nHopefully that happens soon. BRIO offers a kind of taste-level that’s not only unique in China, but frankly most of the world. I’m also hoping that they eventually open a location in the US. When I suggested the idea to George last week, he smiled. \n\nYou can follow BRIO at their social media accounts on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/briobeijing/)\n and [Weibo](http://www.weibo.com/briobeijing)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f7e5959fa94339158a060cf0870ac69a/tumblr_inline_para0cqQvo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a72b58ef5c851435810efb9439316e47/tumblr_inline_para0ciPoQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a958500d83ff1ed912b05ef0e66a1ee/tumblr_inline_para0d1EfT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/48c10e67945b3e0f8a61c2002c6aab9f/tumblr_inline_para0dtyAS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/54d24a1959dcd9947dfc21fd743b6872/tumblr_inline_para0dUMb61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/50a17698c4c45905cbcd90d1d6af647e/tumblr_inline_para0e5pCo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3fba2e13d4127b19ce10c2a3b4e0118e/tumblr_inline_para0eUDCn1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/92285e495341a2a892712e07d945d128/tumblr_inline_para0fUwxT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/91dc4d98aa52136e0ec79d8438140726/tumblr_inline_para0fbS6Y1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/016de4fbc6d820a52133da70b77ddb51/tumblr_inline_para0fhd4k1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f40636e3a11ac5fa96cfbd78bb7cf720/tumblr_inline_para0g9h2Z1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/998e58dbcd258379ac211abeb2f9fe84/tumblr_inline_para0gVYaC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bf794125bba944fd4b80da3952c6d3cf/tumblr_inline_para0hNay81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5a76eccfb6dfcda687a6cddec3a4958/tumblr_inline_para0hJs2y1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ff4d98bab1179f572a5255209531986/tumblr_inline_para0iDMIq1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1bafb049925d882f40c97505b1dc1786/tumblr_inline_para0iYj9e1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6dbb96d8f62daa990701cf2c83b0e837/tumblr_inline_para0iIQ9Q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b1c379a6f0d27f84e290d88f36cbd418/tumblr_inline_para0jOhWs1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0bdb9bf82a09fe812735f828358d60a5/tumblr_inline_para0jxNNp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/87b973bff615787f3834542cf1e4be7c/tumblr_inline_para0jXUAN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/077eb45a2b6928f16da4dfd2c141126f/tumblr_inline_para0kP9R31qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8869e2a079d9fd2bf61d093dbeed74ef/tumblr_inline_para0kR1Xv1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc9c473a9fccd1f187f88fa32466ae8a/tumblr_inline_para0lCRtB1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/25136aebaa74417ff457741e0b4af815/tumblr_inline_para0lDSW11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a80b7a1d774418257c779ecd7933263/tumblr_inline_para0lVCXu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a323a98963b4b99ea9ed7a04f9cb7965/tumblr_inline_para0mB4dR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d8b9f465221c1655663d07b86bdd90d/tumblr_inline_para0nrzZU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/788d3d316695dcf9dba354aac4aefb32/tumblr_inline_para0nsxdc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8fb9c3032e5576c0b7644136426943ae/tumblr_inline_para0rvgao1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d4386eeeaa5e799de45a85e4c2264dbb/tumblr_inline_para0rDoe41qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/802434fb67ccf47e58bc90b4fd0ba483/tumblr_inline_para0rFLCM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f0c9ab80800b30b24dd67130ba28026/tumblr_inline_para0shTP21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1412d76843010d2b6458ca1c2955f485/tumblr_inline_para072Eb51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nFor the past five years, if not longer, luxury goods magazines have been publishing the same story about China every week. The market there is booming, thanks to China’s economic growth, but consumers are said to be “unsophisticated.” Most buy luxury goods as status symbols, rather than for the quality they offer. As a person who’s half-Chinese, it’s hard to not get defensive over these characterizations, but it’s also hard to pretend they aren’t true.\n\nThere are some exceptions, however. George Wang – better known to some as [maomao](http://www.styleforum.net/u/2770/maomao1980)\n on StyleForum and [Beijing1980](http://beijing1980.tumblr.com/)\n on Tumblr – recently opened a menswear boutique in Beijing. Named BRIO, which is Italian for spirit or verve, it offers the kind of classic, softly tailored Italian style that George has always championed. George was in San Francisco last week, so we met at [La Farina](http://www.farina-foods.com/intro.php?url=restaurants)\n for lunch and chatted about his new store.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e97364444b071106a869d156afab1d6/tumblr_inline_para0b9Qfa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nBRIO is an impressive two stories. The first floor, which is street level, holds all of the shop’s menswear offerings. The second floor is downstairs, where you can find a lounge as well as a barbershop (BRIO has an in-house barber who can give a shave and a cut). The idea is make a space where men can hang out, relax, and have a drink; not just buy clothes. Photos show that the lounge is still a work-in-progress, but the space so far looks exceptionally nice.\n\nSo does the list of brands. There are some British makers, such as [Begg](http://www.beggandcompany.com/)\n, [Edward Green](http://www.edwardgreen.com/)\n, and [Sanders](http://www.sanders-uk.com/)\n (BRIO will be carrying Sanders’ Playboy chukkas, which were [made famous by Steve McQueen](http://www.acontinuouslean.com/2013/11/21/other-playboy/)\n). The rest, however, is largely Italian. The store will have [Sartoria Dalcuore](http://www.sartoriadalcuore.com/en/)\n for suits, [Stefano Bemer](http://www.stefanobemersrl.com/)\n for shoes, [Rota](http://www.rotasrl.com/en/index.htm)\n for trousers, and [G.

Published in 1966 in the _New York Herald Tribune_, it’s about how men in the United States are hooked on the allure on custom tailoring.\n\n“Practically all the most powerful men in New York,” Wolfe wrote, “especially on Wall Street, the people in investment houses, banks and law firms, the politicians, \\[and\\] especially Brooklyn Democrats, for some reason \\[…\\] are fanatical about the marginal differences that go into custom tailoring. They are almost like a secret club insignia for them. And yet it is a taboo subject. \\[…\\] At Yale and Harvard, boys think nothing of going over and picking up a copy of _Leer, Poke, Feel, Prod, Tickle, Hot Whips, Modern Mammaries_, and other such magazines, and reading them right out in the open. Sex is not taboo. But when the catalogue comes from Brooks Brothers or J. Press, that’s something they whip out only in private.”\n\nToday, men with The Secret Vice find community online – where they can talk about tailors and clothes without shame. When possible, however, the world of bespoke tailoring is best explored through more traditional social networks. It’s always better to meet with another tailoring enthusiast in person, not only to see what his suits look like in real life, but also to get his thoughts. For a variety of reasons, clients are often eager to give praise, but reluctant to share criticism. To know how someone really feels about their tailor, you have to talk with him behind closed doors.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0e7931335a3f28b82ec0e52a43b247c/tumblr_inline_p9eqpj9m9U1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2b27f31d110e6d4ec9d41f8b19b2baa/tumblr_inline_p9eqpj0KIG1qfex1b_540.png)\n\nWhen I met with [George from BRIO last week](https://dieworkwear.com/post/113262717454/changing-taste-in-china)\n, he was wearing a blue sport coat and grey overcoat from [Sartoria Corcos](http://www.sartoriacorcos.com/)\n, a bespoke tailoring shop based in Florence, Italy. George has been a client of many tailors over the years (he introduced many enthusiasts, including me, to [Liverano](http://liverano.com/en)\n, for example), but tells me that Sartoria Corcos is probably the one he’ll stick with for life.\n\nSartoria Corcos is as small of an operation as you can imagine. The head cutter and tailor is a Japanese man named Kotaro Miyahira, who got his start at [Ring Jacket](http://www.ringjacket.co.jp/)\n before moving to Italy to learn tailoring. His wife does all the buttonholes, and he employs another tailor to do some basic sewing. For the most part, however, it’s a one-man shop. \n\nMiyahira’s style is distinctive, and according to George (who has been his client for five years), has only gotten more Italian with time. “He’s been living in Florence for almost ten years now,” George tells me. “So it’s only natural that he picks up a few things from the locals.” His jackets are slimming, with waists and skirts that sit close to the body, and narrow sleeves that are never too far from the arm. His chests, on the other hand, are slightly swelled – not as much as a true drape cut, but enough to add a little masculine fullness. Shoulders are soft and sloping, but also slightly extended.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/35afd986132c7cf5093daf2d597efdf5/tumblr_inline_p9eqpkod941qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nMost important is how Miyahira cuts his lapels and quarters, and how he sets his buttoning points. His lapels are cut very straight, meaning they lack the belly that you find on English jackets, or the concave line on Liverano’s (notice how [this Steed](http://steedbespoketailors.com/2014/02/05/mixing-brown-blue-the-altered-state-of-mind/584-2/)\n, for example, has lapels that slightly bow outwards, while [these Liveranos](http://ethandesu.com/post/15111409787/liverano-the-second-fitting-pt-2)\n have lapels that bow inwards). His quarters are also distinctively Florentine, so that the fronts sweep back towards the hips. These two elements, combined with a slightly lowered buttoning point that elongates the lapel line, gives these jackets a striking look that’s built on traditional soft tailoring.\n\nWhat’s great about Corcos’ jackets is that they feel so classically Italian, but also have that bit of dash to make them exciting. In some ways, these feel exactly like Miyahira’s story: a young man who fell in love with classic English and Italian clothes in Japan, then went to Italy to learn his trade. They have a sense of traditional style, as well as a bit of youthful flair. Such as the marginal details that are “so small, they’re practically invisible,” as Wolfe put it, yet are critically important to men infected with The Secret Vice. \n\nGeorge tells me that Miyahira doesn’t travel much, as he already has his hands full in Florence and doesn’t pursue things just for the sake of money. He has used trunk shows, however, to see the world (previous ones have taken place in other parts of Europe, as well as his home country of Japan). Miyahira looks like a young man with a lot of life to live. Let’s hope at some point, he’ll want to see the United States. \n\nYou can check out Sartoria Corcos at [their website](http://www.sartoriacorcos.com/)\n, or follow them at

you read [“The Secret Vice?”](https://www.facebook.com/notes/christopher-lin/the-secret-vice-by-wolfe/10151459036725845)\n It’s a wonderful article by the journalist dandy Tom Wolfe. Published in 1966 in the _New York Herald Tribune_, it’s about how men in the United States are hooked on the allure on custom tailoring.\n\n“Practically all the most powerful men in New York,” Wolfe wrote, “especially on Wall Street, the people in investment houses, banks and law firms, the politicians, \\[and\\] especially Brooklyn Democrats, for some reason \\[…\\] are fanatical about the marginal differences that go into custom tailoring. They are almost like a secret club insignia for them. And yet it is a taboo subject. \\[…\\] At Yale and Harvard, boys think nothing of going over and picking up a copy of _Leer, Poke, Feel, Prod, Tickle, Hot Whips, Modern Mammaries_, and other such magazines, and reading them right out in the open. Sex is not taboo. But when the catalogue comes from Brooks Brothers or J. Press, that’s something they whip out only in private.”\n\nToday, men with The Secret Vice find community online – where they can talk about tailors and clothes without shame. When possible, however, the world of bespoke tailoring is best explored through more traditional social networks. It’s always better to meet with another tailoring enthusiast in person, not only to see what his suits look like in real life, but also to get his thoughts. For a variety of reasons, clients are often eager to give praise, but reluctant to share criticism. To know how someone really feels about their tailor, you have to talk with him behind closed doors.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0e7931335a3f28b82ec0e52a43b247c/tumblr_inline_p9eqpj9m9U1qfex1b_540.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2b27f31d110e6d4ec9d41f8b19b2baa/tumblr_inline_p9eqpj0KIG1qfex1b_540.png)\n\nWhen I met with [George from BRIO last week](https://dieworkwear.com/post/113262717454/changing-taste-in-china)\n, he was wearing a blue sport coat and grey overcoat from [Sartoria Corcos](http://www.sartoriacorcos.com/)\n, a bespoke tailoring shop based in Florence, Italy.

Their uppers are hand lasted, bottoms hand beveled, and soles hand attached. Instead of using Goodyear welting or Blake stitching (which are machine-executed operations), Saint Crispin’s are hand welted with a pegged waist. By eliminating the stitching, they can get much more shaping into their waists and arches.\n\nIt’s that shaping that accounts for so much of Saint Crispin’s appeal. Check out these studded Dainite soles below, for example. Instead of the chunky versions you’ve seen from almost every other maker, Saint Crispin’s carefully bevels theirs to match the narrow waist of their shoes. This is done by first shaping the sole with a chisel, and then fine-tuning it with a rasp. \n\nAs it goes with most things, these are best seen in person.

Except for what goes into the waistband, there’s no real internal construction to speak of – just pocket bags and lining, which are hidden underneath the garment’s shell. They’re also a lot easier to fit, which makes them nice for custom tailoring. Once your tailor has your pattern down – one for flat front pants, and another for pleats – you can order trousers straight-to-finish. \n\nI recently received my first order from [Salvatore Ambrosi](http://ambrosi-napoli.tumblr.com/)\n, the famous (and at times infamous) tailor from the Spanish Quarters of Naples. Salvatore, for those unfamiliar, had a meteoric rise eight years ago when he was first introduced to the online community of bespoke tailoring enthusiasts. People were crazy for his stuff, but after a few good years, Salvatore couldn’t keep up with the increasing number of orders. Deliveries were delayed and emails went unanswered. As far as I know, everyone eventually got their trousers or money back, but people are still rightly sour about the experience. The last time [I wrote about Salvatore](https://dieworkwear.com/post/21385195742/ambrosi-napoli)\n, a well-respected menswear writer emailed me to say I was breaking iGent omertà.

Except for what goes into the waistband, there’s no real internal construction to speak of – just pocket bags and lining, which are hidden underneath the garment’s shell. They’re also a lot easier to fit, which makes them nice for custom tailoring. Once your tailor has your pattern down – one for flat front pants, and another for pleats – you can order trousers straight-to-finish. \n\nI recently received my first order from [Salvatore Ambrosi](http://ambrosi-napoli.tumblr.com/)\n, the famous (and at times infamous) tailor from the Spanish Quarters of Naples. Salvatore, for those unfamiliar, had a meteoric rise eight years ago when he was first introduced to the online community of bespoke tailoring enthusiasts. People were crazy for his stuff, but after a few good years, Salvatore couldn’t keep up with the increasing number of orders. Deliveries were delayed and emails went unanswered. As far as I know, everyone eventually got their trousers or money back, but people are still rightly sour about the experience. The last time [I wrote about Salvatore](https://dieworkwear.com/post/21385195742/ambrosi-napoli)\n, a well-respected menswear writer emailed me to say I was breaking iGent omertà. He was probably half joking, but also … probably half not. \n\nSince that debacle five years ago, Salvatore has slowly rebuilt his business. He’s developed a healthy customer base in East Asia, partnered with boutiques to handle the logistics of his orders, and expanded his workshop.

In the fall, they’ll bring back some of the cloths in their Fine Classics book, and in the next couple of months, they’ll reissue some things from Smiths’s Botany and Gilt Edge, as well as W.

In the fall, they’ll bring back some of the cloths in their Fine Classics book, and in the next couple of months, they’ll reissue some things from Smiths’s Botany and Gilt Edge, as well as W. Bill’s Shetland. Those interested in ordering can contact one of Harrisons’ distributors (which here in the US would be [Isles Textile Group](http://www.islestextilegroup.com/)\n). The Carlo Barbera for H. Lesser book can also be seen in [large format here](http://online.fliphtml5.com/vegr/uscw/)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e8dba86838ca6afa6d7a7c512ba5286/tumblr_inline_nm1j3mH0je1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9037b5811cd0fe3286c248a0db907b22/tumblr_inline_nm1j1nGp5q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/21d7aae647e4c82a6bd71d2a7d73e3db/tumblr_inline_nm1j1y0Dkk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/95ad11c2370a9cba38325bba7511da07/tumblr_inline_nm1j2iEtjK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0fd2f7171a334e91fcb18bc9fc3b127f/tumblr_inline_nm1j2rpoIT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3304b478282d932fb9613a07b0ee3c46/tumblr_inline_nm1j30NozG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4e64a74d9537053ba3521ef33e475142/tumblr_inline_nm1j3cS8nc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c6feafa88d7a2eaa737471ec5dea019/tumblr_inline_nm1j4gZFsu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9c0681db4edd98498b952d98b08239a/tumblr_inline_nm1j5fJEln1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/be1a14e92dab0c521af0f43715efcca1/tumblr_inline_nm1j25soJH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba598f643c84de0fef45e985fff7d395/tumblr_inline_nm1j2baFcp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/60389a08ab2d930cbadf047fd021376b/tumblr_inline_nm1z92Hx0P1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/de1236839327d8040b8a141fe0aa69a6/tumblr_inline_nm1z98kxVE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/af7b9f7a337b90c61cb4c68431d03a54/tumblr_inline_nm1z9eRl271qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Warm Weather Patterns — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Warm Weather Patterns — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Sport coats in the fall and winter are often alive with patterns.

The editors of _Apparel Arts_ thought they knew. In 1936, they published “Permanent Modern,” a fourteen-page article introducing their vision of modern menswear retailing.\n\nThe article spares little in details. Included are elaborate floor plans and descriptions of the materials that should be used for the architecture, fixtures, and display cases. According to the editors, things should look modern, but not “voguish modern,” as you want to catch the customer’s eye, yet also make the place feel inviting. They even specified the lighting and air conditioning systems (two whole pages were dedicated to that). Should the reader want to implement their vision, they included a directory for the contractors, suppliers, and equipment manufacturers who could help with the store’s construction.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cea78ac39190d2df982e615503c38e86/tumblr_inline_nm6xlgIs1c1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e75a9c181c1168f4b1c075c5722c828/tumblr_inline_nm6xlp9ByS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f1162ea70d6805db244f611c8e32ead5/tumblr_inline_nm6xlvda0M1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe store they imagined was grand – something like a Saks Fifth Avenue, but solely dedicated to men. On the first floor, you have accessories and footwear. Low, countertop cases are used to display ties, pocket squares, and gloves. The departments for hats and shoes are sectioned off from the main accessories floor, so as to provide customers with a certain level of privacy. Replacing the old-fashioned theatre-chair seating arrangements in the footwear department is a group of modern, upholstered wall seats. And in the hat department, the display cases are designed so that they can be easily used to promote gifts during the holiday season.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/45c6d88b1d851001edebaef6f8b9672b/tumblr_inline_nm6xm7rUrq1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/820baefb0c997ead8fccedef80aec4ac/tumblr_inline_nm6xme2cWQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nBelow is the basement, which is partly dedicated to shipping and receiving, as well as holding inventory and equipment. There’s also a large club lounge, which takes up most of the floor. Here, fruitwood furniture and brown/ white upholstered sofas decorate the main space. A bar sits at one end of the room, while a copper mantel fireplace is located at the other. Green carpet runs throughout.\n\nThe club is meant to be a space where customers can come in, relax, and have a drink, but they can also enjoy the valet service, barber shop, and provisions for massage, showers, and lockers. The basement has its own exits, which lead out to the sidewalks just beyond the front of the store, so that men can stay after-hours, even when the store itself is closed.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b87c011348a17d4dd7919c7f7026d46d/tumblr_inline_nm6xmvLcU01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c4049707c042e64408c96ad2211221ad/tumblr_inline_nm6xn2AGBc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nIn a strange (and seemingly needless) plan, the editors also imagined that the first floor’s display windows could be mechanically lowered to the basement, where employees would do their trimming before raising them back up again.

The back of these floors have sections for seasonal promotions and in-house alterations services. The front half is where the rest of the clothing is displayed, with a small lounge area separating the two. Lounges, I imagine, are necessary since we have four massive floors dedicated to men’s style at this point.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5a196c6dcacd4b50fcbe949ee1f4424/tumblr_inline_nm6xo3gs2d1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/53236cacc868a3765fbdad2aa25b3030/tumblr_inline_nm6xobFbXi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe fifth floor has two main divisions – the boys’ shop and the prep shop, with a lounge (again) separating the two. The boys shop has an animated and playful feeling, while the prep shop shows more dignity and restraint. The prep shop, as you can see, is mainly dedicated to tailored clothing, which – for boys of high-school age – has almost all but disappeared.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7468a2ac43b8998cb822cf29c908d1fc/tumblr_inline_nm6xorRQsZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nFinally, since trekking through five floors (six, if you came from the basement’s club lounge) must be tiring, the top-most floor has a penthouse restaurant with an open air dining terrace. Apparel Arts’ editors imagined that the terrace could be converted into a skating rink in the wintertime, for showing apparel on live models.\n\n“Permanent Modern” was supposed to be an enduring concept of modern menswear retailing, but such massive commercial complexes feel so archaic now. For many men, including myself, places such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus feel too impersonal, which is why many have gone to smaller and more specialized boutiques.\n\nThe best menswear store I’ve seen is [Battistoni](http://blog.styleforum.net/shopping-rome-battistoni/)\n. Rather than modern, it feels old-school – the wood-paneled walls, marble floors, and fine art lend a sort of a rarified air, and the shop consists of just a single floor (not six) with small, separate rooms dedicated to different goods. Supposedly, the place used to be something of a salon, where men would drink and trade gossip while they got measured. The owner of Battistoni once told me Humphrey Bogart came so often that he asked if he could leave a bottle of whiskey for himself here, but who knows if that’s just lore.\n\nIn any case, I guess tailored clothing can be timeless, but taste in retail changes.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/deb7399b354be8fc19329fcf84f894cb/tumblr_inline_nm6xpcjHxT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9932090df087ff9d6d6519ef64861c74/tumblr_inline_nm6xpiPYzG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/919a49957481f075c3a4bce04817228d/tumblr_inline_nm6xpnHgE81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/113de94cf2b62fd704e3c3b8cdbf2dd4/tumblr_inline_nm6xpvaLm01qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eeb88d8d067f33b11718f44722b995f9/tumblr_inline_nm6xqmzFZb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3f41978e94495f776b2416b36a2c0e2/tumblr_inline_nm6xksqWcl1qfex1b_540.png)\n\nWhat would be the ideal menswear store?

When I was growing up, it was a quiet, sleepy city with cloudy weather and an easy-going attitude (something like a Canadian version of their neighbors in Seattle). Nowadays, the place feels a lot more hip and bustling. Their menswear scene, for example, rivals that of any North American city’s outside of New York. You have [Roden Gray](http://rodengray.com/)\n and [Haven](http://havenshop.ca/)\n for high-end streetwear; [Dutil](http://dutildenim.com/)\n and [NiftyDo](http://nifty-do.com/)\n for denim and denim-related things; and a dozen or so shops for everyday labels such as APC and Gitman Vintage.\n\nOne of my favorites is [Neighbour](http://www.shopneighbour.com/)\n – a small, cozy boutique that’s tucked away inside one of Gastown’s hidden courtyards. Although the shop is Canadian, it has a Scandinavian sense of simplicity. Its interior relies a lot on glass, light-colored woods, and concrete, and instead overcrowding the small space with too many racks and shelves, everything feels spacious and manageable.\n\nSome of what Neighbour carries is probably too designer-y for the average reader here, although I think it’s all great. [1205](http://www.shopneighbour.com/collections/1205-mens)\n′s Paula Gerbase, for example, worked for a while on Savile Row before starting her very modern, austere-looking sportswear label (she’s also [designing a footwear line](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/business/international/john-lobbs-shoes-paula-gerbase.html?_r=0)\n for John Lobb). Additionally, [Christophe Lemaire](http://www.shopneighbour.com/collections/lemaire-mens)\n might be one of the most interesting menswear designers at the moment. He recently left Hermes, where he handled womenswear, and caused quite a stir with his [FW15 show](http://nowfashion.com/lemaire-menswear-fall-winter-2015-paris-11935)\n(I think it’s one of the best in recent memory).\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/48ad43d37b2914a22357f99cc64585ec/tumblr_inline_nmgxrbTVFW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe rest of the store has things that can be easily incorporated into any wardrobe. Saager Dilawri – the New York transplant who started Neighbour in 2011 – tells me he only carries things that resonate with him.

When I was growing up, it was a quiet, sleepy city with cloudy weather and an easy-going attitude (something like a Canadian version of their neighbors in Seattle). Nowadays, the place feels a lot more hip and bustling. Their menswear scene, for example, rivals that of any North American city’s outside of New York. You have [Roden Gray](http://rodengray.com/)\n and [Haven](http://havenshop.ca/)\n for high-end streetwear; [Dutil](http://dutildenim.com/)\n and [NiftyDo](http://nifty-do.com/)\n for denim and denim-related things; and a dozen or so shops for everyday labels such as APC and Gitman Vintage.\n\nOne of my favorites is [Neighbour](http://www.shopneighbour.com/)\n – a small, cozy boutique that’s tucked away inside one of Gastown’s hidden courtyards. Although the shop is Canadian, it has a Scandinavian sense of simplicity. Its interior relies a lot on glass, light-colored woods, and concrete, and instead overcrowding the small space with too many racks and shelves, everything feels spacious and manageable.\n\nSome of what Neighbour carries is probably too designer-y for the average reader here, although I think it’s all great. [1205](http://www.shopneighbour.com/collections/1205-mens)\n′s Paula Gerbase, for example, worked for a while on Savile Row before starting her very modern, austere-looking sportswear label (she’s also [designing a footwear line](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/business/international/john-lobbs-shoes-paula-gerbase.html?_r=0)\n for John Lobb). Additionally, [Christophe Lemaire](http://www.shopneighbour.com/collections/lemaire-mens)\n might be one of the most interesting menswear designers at the moment. He recently left Hermes, where he handled womenswear, and caused quite a stir with his [FW15 show](http://nowfashion.com/lemaire-menswear-fall-winter-2015-paris-11935)\n(I think it’s one of the best in recent memory).\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/48ad43d37b2914a22357f99cc64585ec/tumblr_inline_nmgxrbTVFW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe rest of the store has things that can be easily incorporated into any wardrobe. Saager Dilawri – the New York transplant who started Neighbour in 2011 – tells me he only carries things that resonate with him. He likes [Stephan Schneider](http://www.shopneighbour.com/collections/stephan-schneider-mens)\n and [Our Legacy](http://www.shopneighbour.com/collections/our-legacy-mens)\n because their designs are interesting, yet also feel approachable and unpretentious (I’m a big fan of Schneider’s knitwear and Our Legacy’s jeans). He also enjoys [O’Ballou](http://www.shopneighbour.com/collections/o-ballou-mens)\n for their 1950s sense of casual Italian style and the Japanese label [Niuhans](http://www.shopneighbour.com/collections/niuhans-mens)\n for their botanically-dyed clothes (he describes them as having a sense of “air-like lightness” and “clean perfection”).\n\nWhat makes Neighbour great are the same things that make [“warm minimalism”](https://dieworkwear.com/post/107606205139/warm-minimalism)\n appealing. Rather than the snootiness that can sometimes come with tailoring, the cosplay of workwear, or the busyness of some casualwear labels (looking at you, Daiki Suzuki), Neighbour’s clothes feel simple and relatable. I’ve bought some Patrik Ervell outerwear and Stephan Schneider sweaters here, and often wear them with boots and slim-straight jeans. They’re great for when you want to look put together, but don’t necessarily want to make a statement.\n\nTwo months ago, Neighbour opened a women’s wear shop around the corner from their menswear store. It carries the same aesthetic and – like their main location – also has the kind of housewares and quirky accessories that makes the place feel fun (who doesn’t want [large, brass paperclips?](http://www.shopneighbour.com/products/brass-paperclips-large)\n).

Linen wears cool when it’s warm and warm when it’s cool, which makes it perfect for those moderate temperatures in the early spring and late fall. It’s also great for layering when cashmere or wool might feel too stuffy. I’ve been wearing my linen knits on weekends with brown leather jackets, tan flannel trousers, and brown suede chukkas. So much of classic men’s style is bifurcated between formal city wear and casual country clothing. This feels like a nice in-between.\n\nThe problem with a lot of linen knits, however, is that they don’t hang very well. Since linen is derived from a plant fiber, rather than animal hair, it doesn’t have any crimp, so the yarns feel a bit lifeless. Inis Meain’s knits are the only exceptions I’ve seen. Their linen yarns have a nice, dry hand and a great spring-back quality, which gives their sweaters some body and ensures that the cuffs won’t easily stretch-out. These are essentially just like your best cold-weather knits, but made for the springtime.\n\nGiven the favorable exchange rate, you can find Inis Meain sweaters a bit cheaper abroad, although you also risk getting hit with customs and duties.

The third isn’t necessarily expensive, but the price feels high for what you’re getting: a 16″ by 16″ piece of cotton that will run you anywhere between $50 and $100. Even the best European mills will sell you half-a-meter of shirting for that kind of money.\n\nCotton squares are surprisingly useful though – especially in the warmer months. White linen will work with almost any kind of jacket, but it often demands a Presidential fold, which can look a bit formal. Silk can be worn in a more casual puff, but it’s often best with tweed and flannel, as the sheen of silk complements the matte-finish of wool. Wool squares, on the other hand, work well with silk neckties for the same reason, but they can feel a bit autumnal.\n\nCotton squares, then, are like the spring/ summer version of a wool hank. You can wear them with casual suits or sport coats, and pair them with silk rep ties. Few will noticed the difference between a cotton and wool pocket square once it’s in your pocket, but it’s nice to be able to wear something that feels a bit more seasonal.\n\nDrake’s has cotton squares with big, bold patterns that are as handsome as they are versatile. You can find them these days at [Mr. Porter](http://bit.ly/1OHA44x)\n, [No Man Walks Alone](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/accessories/pocket-squares.html)\n, [The Armoury](http://shop.thearmoury.com/us/categories/pocketsquares)\n, [Exquisite Trimmings](http://www.exquisitetrimmings.com/products/Pocket-Squares)\n, and [A Suitable Wardrobe](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/accessories/pocket-squares)\n. Put This On (the main site I write for) also has a [pocket square shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/putthison)\n. My college Jesse handpicks vintage fabrics from around the world, and then sends them a tailor in Los Angeles so they can be finished with hand-stitched edges (a rare thing, even among top-shelf labels). [Vanda Fine Clothing](http://vandafineclothing.com/)\n is another great source, and they too finish their squares with hand-stitching.\n\nOther notables include [Tie Your Tie](http://shop.thearmoury.com/us/categories/pocketsquares)\n, who has cotton hanks that feel a bit more airy than Drake’s, as well as Savile Row’s [Richard James](http://bit.ly/1OHk6r9)\n, who’s known for their fun take on tailored clothing. The French weaver Simonnot Godard also has some in linen/ cotton blends, which are sold at [The Hanger Project](http://www.hangerproject.com/clothing-accessories/pockect-squares.html)\n and [Barney’s](http://bit.ly/1FY4mPl)\n. Sometimes you can find them on deep discount at [Barney’s Warehouse](http://bit.ly/1J7sxIs)\n.\n\nSo yes, these are a bit of an extravagant purchase, but at least they’re an affordable extravagance. Throw one in your pocket and never admit to anyone what you paid (including yourself).\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7b3554afb24f6ff18a7193d7e19e1a75/tumblr_inline_nmo2lkkBHD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f74c66a2b29fcff08fc67c6a67e62c0/tumblr_inline_nmwg1sCVwO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd2322678d8ca9859f604d29dce7f94f/tumblr_inline_nmwg1xw42v1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5aaf3b905bcaef045b4b47d9649829e/tumblr_inline_nmwg21SeoM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/58f9c7323da9f2d1c28f5f7e29773bb4/tumblr_inline_nmwg27J7q11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8fd54000332616f753f73232aa4d5510/tumblr_inline_nmwg2c9pwc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/44584e71b51cb53d92cdb8b63e88ba4a/tumblr_inline_nmwg2j5tTQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/11b020a9d433378e84a52a48fdfdf02f/tumblr_inline_nmwg2pXthA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/381ba4539a0bf5b71709485608c53735/tumblr_inline_nmwg2wSmyq1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f7e1ea1549bc60b5328de7796a44d1/tumblr_inline_nmwg32gpWY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5049a4ca45584925bd16dd0e62cbb12d/tumblr_inline_nmwg38wrIo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a8e08203a7e401cb96567a5bc3930c49/tumblr_inline_nmo2lf9c1Y1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nWhen it comes to absurdly-priced clothing, few things beat [$3,200 designer ponchos](http://bit.ly/1ELEVPt)\n, [$400 grey sweatshirts](http://www.endclothing.com/brands/nigel-cabourn/nigel-cabourn-crew-sweat-nc-s15-wwj-1-gy.html)\n, and $75 cotton pocket squares.

Wool squares, on the other hand, work well with silk neckties for the same reason, but they can feel a bit autumnal.\n\nCotton squares, then, are like the spring/ summer version of a wool hank. You can wear them with casual suits or sport coats, and pair them with silk rep ties. Few will noticed the difference between a cotton and wool pocket square once it’s in your pocket, but it’s nice to be able to wear something that feels a bit more seasonal.\n\nDrake’s has cotton squares with big, bold patterns that are as handsome as they are versatile. You can find them these days at [Mr. Porter](http://bit.ly/1OHA44x)\n, [No Man Walks Alone](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/accessories/pocket-squares.html)\n, [The Armoury](http://shop.thearmoury.com/us/categories/pocketsquares)\n, [Exquisite Trimmings](http://www.exquisitetrimmings.com/products/Pocket-Squares)\n, and [A Suitable Wardrobe](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/accessories/pocket-squares)\n. Put This On (the main site I write for) also has a [pocket square shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/putthison)\n. My college Jesse handpicks vintage fabrics from around the world, and then sends them a tailor in Los Angeles so they can be finished with hand-stitched edges (a rare thing, even among top-shelf labels). [Vanda Fine Clothing](http://vandafineclothing.com/)\n is another great source, and they too finish their squares with hand-stitching.\n\nOther notables include [Tie Your Tie](http://shop.thearmoury.com/us/categories/pocketsquares)\n, who has cotton hanks that feel a bit more airy than Drake’s, as well as Savile Row’s [Richard James](http://bit.ly/1OHk6r9)\n, who’s known for their fun take on tailored clothing. The French weaver Simonnot Godard also has some in linen/ cotton blends, which are sold at [The Hanger Project](http://www.hangerproject.com/clothing-accessories/pockect-squares.html)\n and [Barney’s](http://bit.ly/1FY4mPl)\n. Sometimes you can find them on deep discount at [Barney’s Warehouse](http://bit.ly/1J7sxIs)\n.\n\nSo yes, these are a bit of an extravagant purchase, but at least they’re an affordable extravagance. Throw one in your pocket and never admit to anyone what you paid (including yourself).\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7b3554afb24f6ff18a7193d7e19e1a75/tumblr_inline_nmo2lkkBHD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f74c66a2b29fcff08fc67c6a67e62c0/tumblr_inline_nmwg1sCVwO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd2322678d8ca9859f604d29dce7f94f/tumblr_inline_nmwg1xw42v1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5aaf3b905bcaef045b4b47d9649829e/tumblr_inline_nmwg21SeoM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/58f9c7323da9f2d1c28f5f7e29773bb4/tumblr_inline_nmwg27J7q11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8fd54000332616f753f73232aa4d5510/tumblr_inline_nmwg2c9pwc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/44584e71b51cb53d92cdb8b63e88ba4a/tumblr_inline_nmwg2j5tTQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/11b020a9d433378e84a52a48fdfdf02f/tumblr_inline_nmwg2pXthA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/381ba4539a0bf5b71709485608c53735/tumblr_inline_nmwg2wSmyq1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f7e1ea1549bc60b5328de7796a44d1/tumblr_inline_nmwg32gpWY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5049a4ca45584925bd16dd0e62cbb12d/tumblr_inline_nmwg38wrIo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"An Affordable Extravagance — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"An Affordable Extravagance — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"When it comes to absurdly-priced clothing, few things beat $3,200 designer ponchos, $400 grey sweatshirts, and $75 cotton pocket squares.

Using data from 132 countries, Blanchflower found that people often become increasingly miserable as they head into their 40s. Colloquially known as the mid-life crisis, economists represent this trajectory with an inverted U-curve (for those who aren’t mathematically inclined, such as me, this is shaped like a “frowny face”). This pattern has been long known to psychologists, philosophers, and mystics, but Blanchflower found the exact age when the average midlife crisis peaks: 48, give or take a year depending on some conditions. “The curve’s trajectory holds true in countries where the median wage is high and where it is not, and where people tend to live longer and where they don’t,” he writes. The good news is that, according to science, things indeed get better. After age 48, people slowly start to find contentment.\n\nWhy is this? Some suggest this statistical pattern is hardwired into our biology. [A 2012 study of chimpanzees and orangutans](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/scientists-say-chimps-and-orangutans-have-mid-life-crises-136191276/)\n found that our closest evolutionary ancestors also fall into middle-aged ruts. Theirs tends to peak at the age of 30, which closely traces along the human timeline (a little past the midway point for life expectancy). The study’s methodology, however, is questionable at best. Accurately measuring happiness in humans is notoriously tricky, so you can only imagine what it’s like for great apes. “Each ape has several keepers, and every keeper was asked to assess the psychological well-being of their particular animal using a short questionnaire,” explains co-author Andrew Oswald. Among the questions, keepers had to answer: “If you were that animal, how happy do you think you would be on a scale of 1-7?” (I found this question to be so hilarious, it briefly relieved me from my miserable existence).\n\nEconomists don’t yet know why life gets better after age 48, but they have a few ideas. It could be that people learn to quell their unreasonable aspirations after mid-life, as well as adapt to their strengths and weaknesses. They may learn to compare themselves less to others or appreciate their remaining years as similar-aged peers pass on. A more straightforward explanation could be that the population sample at the end of the age spectrum is biased. Happier people tend to live longer, so the inverted U-curve simply reflects who has managed to stick around.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/114a0ba713573d6d891845fa2bfa3b4b/d4c1523bd533f41c-1e/s540x810/8dd0c9045f6ac77107ee27335d450da8a40ab547.jpg)\n\nAnother theory is that we learn how to live with our mistakes. When we’re young, many of us expect to eventually achieve perfection in various areas of adulthood. We imagine ourselves one day being in a happy and harmonious marriage, owning a home, earning the respect of our peers, and being engaged in deeply fulfilling work. But the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry. Somewhere along the way, cracks and fissures start to appear in our plans, and small decisions compounded over time have a way of taking us to unexpected places. It’s then that we begin to ruminate over the “what ifs.” What if I had done this and not done that? Most of all, what if my life turned out differently?\n\nAs I’ve gotten older, I’ve found that it’s easy to spiral into regret. You start to ruminate over what you did or did not do, and suddenly all your failures come into full relief. [A psychology study at UC Berkeley found that](https://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Zhang_2016.pdf)\n, when those moments happen, you can learn and grow from mistakes by facing them directly with some self-compassion. “Regrets are common,” writes psychology professors Jia Wei Zhang and Serena Chen. “Instead of wishing to go back to un-do or do, what people can do right now is confront these regretted life experiences with self-compassion, paving the way for personal improvement.” It helps to situate one’s shortcomings as part of the common human experience. To fail is to live a fuller life.\n\nThis is easier said than done, of course, but perhaps that’s why older people are more content. The movie cliche, “I wish things could just go back to the way they were,” suggests that we should be able to move onto good times, but as though the bad times never happened. Maybe as you get older, you learn how to embrace, rather than trying to erase, those memories.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9fa0bf1784f59c851a81b3474865760f/d4c1523bd533f41c-70/s540x810/00b1ecd94466e01196d9e748a20ae3d7c4a8f096.jpg)\n\n[Kei Shigenaga](https://keishigenaga.com/)\n, a relatively new jewelry label based in Japan, represents some of these ideas through finely crafted accessories. The label was started a few years ago by two friends who met in New York City. Wataru Shimosato, a thin, long-haired Japanese model with a talent for photography, serves as the company’s creative director. Then there’s Kei Shigenaga, the company’s namesake and silversmith, who makes all of the jewelry by hand in his Tokyo-based studio.\n\nEven though these are glimmering, shiny pieces rendered in sterling silver or gold, Kei Shigenaga’s jewelry pieces feel dark and brooding. There’s a running tension between the image of fine jewelry as being something delicate here, but also tough. “Jewelry isn’t just about fashion, it can also be an art object that you can have with you every day,” the Japanese silversmith once told [Eugene Rabkin at StyleZeitgeist](https://www.sz-mag.com/news/2018/06/introducing-kei-shigenaga-jewelry/)\n. “In my work, I try to concentrate on the roughness of precious metals.”\n\nFor his designs, Shigenaga takes inspiration from traditional Japanese culture. The twin, sterling silver pendants on his [Ryu necklace](https://keishigenaga.com/collections/all-items/products/ryu-necklace)\n, which almost look like liquid silver droplets, represent the two carps in Japanese lore. According to legend, a school of fish was swimming up the Yellow River one day when they approached a waterfall. When the current started to get too rough, most of them turned back. But two koi fish remained and spent the next hundred years trying to swim up the cliff. At last, when they reached the top, the Gods turned these two spiraling carps into a beautiful golden dragon. [That’s why koi fish are used in Japanese tattooing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl8Be7_E1vM)\n to represent strength, independence, and perseverance. It’s said that their nature is to swim upstream.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a2ab80a6b451ecb7d2def5347eb291a0/d4c1523bd533f41c-d4/s540x810/1b76e1d55800785ff3f8ac848d2ddd69a3ac2d96.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f747abe6899fc9b905035bf710950f03/d4c1523bd533f41c-59/s540x810/305eda82f0df15e443b222943f414b598ceb8b12.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cafa93eb5b080d2ddd97ef95316265a5/d4c1523bd533f41c-5d/s540x810/f51648642a6b2b82c1e8b03611420032bf80c98c.png)\n\nIn the last year or so, Shigenaga has been inspired by _kintsugi_, the Japanese art of repairing broken ceramics with a gold-peppered lacquer. The method supposedly dates back to the Muromachi period when 15th-century Japanese shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa accidentally broke his favorite tea bowl. He sent the broken ceramic pieces back to China for repair, but upon the bowl’s return, Yoshimasa was horrified with how the shards had been affixed together using ugly metal staples. So he tasked his local craftsmen with finding a more aesthetically pleasing solution. The method they came up with was later known as _kintsugi_ – _kin_ meaning golden, _tsugi_ for joinery. Instead of trying to disguise the fault lines and render them invisible, these craftspeople made something artful out of the broken pieces by gluing them together using a golden lacquer.\n\nAs a philosophy, _kintsugi_ can be seen as part of the broader Japanese tradition of _wabi-sabi_, which cherishes that which is simple, unpretentious, and old. This idea, which underscores some themes in Zen Buddhism, says that old, weathered items shouldn’t be neglected or discarded, but valued and repaired with enormous care. _Kintsugi_ is also similar to the Japanese idea of _mushin_, or “no mind,” which carries connotations of “fully existing within the moment, of non-attachment, of equanimity amid changing conditions, of removal from the desire to impose one’s will upon the world.” In her essay “A Tearoom View of Mended Ceramics,” published in the anthology _[Flickwerk](http://annacolibri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Flickwerk_The_Aesthetics_of_Mended_Japanese_Ceramics.pdf)\n_, Christy Bartlett writes about the philosophy behind Japanese ceramics:\n\n> Mended ceramics foremost convey a sense of the passage of time. The vicissitudes of existence over time, to which all humans are susceptible, could not be clearer than in the breaks, the knocks, and the shattering to which ceramic ware too is subject. \\[…\\] Mended ceramics convey simultaneously a sense of rupture and of continuity. That one moment in which the incident occurred is forever captured in the lines and fields of lacquer mending. It becomes an eternally present moment yet a moment that oddly enough segues into another where perishability is circumvented by repair. Simultaneously we have the expression of frailty and of resilience, life before the incident and life after. Yet the object is not the same. In its rebirth, it assumes a new identity that incorporates yet transcends the previous identity. Like the cycle of reincarnation, one life draws to a close and another begins.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2014b2d2087b44450d47c0bba47a2180/d4c1523bd533f41c-dd/s540x810/6558863d4e0a408c3256cb0f988aa4eddf6ab067.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6df78b0d59d6bcc91ba5a84a9c5dce7a/d4c1523bd533f41c-f5/s540x810/fb4100d9544ec1d425ab13ab005294a7eab5d89a.jpg)\n\nShigenaga’s jewelry isn’t literally broken and then repaired with _kintsugi_, but the company makes their rings, bangles, and even hair ties to mimic the aesthetic. Fault lines are built into the sterling silver pieces, and then molten 18k gold is poured into the cracks. If I had one criticism, it would be that it can be hard to spot the contrasting gold lines at first. The detailing is faint and subtle, but on the upside, this also makes it easier to match metals in an outfit. And, perhaps, it would be missing the point if you were to insist on perfection from a _kintsugi_\\-inspired object.\n\nThere is, of course, the argument that, like pre-distressed clothing, _kintsugi_ jewelry mistakes the aesthetic for substance. Since _kintsugi’s_ introduction 600 years ago, Japanese craftsmen have been accused of purposely breaking ceramics, repairing them with gold, and selling the objects to elites who are hungry for commitment-free spirituality. Admittedly, there’s also something mawkishly sentimental about the symbolism. But in an age that values youth and perfection, the art of _kintsugi_ says we should value that which is scarred, broken, or imperfect, starting with ourselves and those around us. I like Kei Shigenaga’s jewelry as a reminder of that wisdom. \n\nLast year, I bought one of their [chunky Koryu rings](https://rstyle.me/+qedkmkpH68hRnlCxCRL8ew)\n on a whim and I’ve been surprised by how often I reach for it. The style naturally goes with brooding contemporary lines such as [Lemaire](https://rstyle.me/+zophG9PHnjT5_YCM0PAvWQ)\n, [Robert Geller](http://www.robertgeller-ny.com/)\n, and [Stephen Schneider](https://bit.ly/2RiLS6Z)\n. I also find that it fits right in with Western-styled workwear, such as a [suede trucker jacket](https://therake.com/barbanera-dark-brown-suede-ennio-trucker-jacket.html)\n worn with a [corded Western shirt](https://therake.com/barbanera-black-fdp-italian-corduroy-shirt.html)\n and [some slim jeans](https://standardandstrange.com/collections/circle-of-friends-studio)\n. So long as the outfit has a bit of an edge – more [Nine Lives](https://standardandstrange.com/collections/nine-lives)\n or [Margiela’s five zip](https://rstyle.me/+BwyCCCC_ly3qf06t--bqtg)\n, rather than a [navy sport coat](https://bit.ly/36fEnBT)\n worn with [grey flannel trousers](https://bit.ly/2GhTvnH)\n – I think these rings make for a nice finishing touch. \n\nKei Shigenaga’s jewelry used to only be available through made-to-order, which meant that all sales were final. In the last few months, a couple of stores have picked them up as part of their stocked inventory. This makes it infinitely easier to figure out your size, as well as return things if you decide you don’t like how the pieces look on you. You can find a selection of their jewelry at [SSENSE](https://rstyle.me/+m4ydDSTrJJauwKtFo5AANQ)\n and [Self Edge](https://www.selfedge.com/)\n. At the moment, Self Edge only carries two of the models in-store, the Kyo and Shisui. However, Kiya tells me they’re getting more shipments later this season and they’ll be online soon. I’ve been thinking about buying the battered, blank signet ring that Kei Shigenaga calls their [Kyoka](https://rstyle.me/+2QTQiAeaqe40DKG_Zia5Jw)\n. It can be dicey to wear multiple rings on one hand, but Kei Shigenaga’s designs, as evidenced by the photos below, are perfect for this kind of thing. \n\nFor more of Kei Shigenaga, you can find them on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/keishigenaga/)\n and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Kei+Shigenaga)\n.

this month, Dartmouth professor and labor economist David Blanchflower published a study on the [statistical relationship between well-being and age](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26641)\n. Using data from 132 countries, Blanchflower found that people often become increasingly miserable as they head into their 40s. Colloquially known as the mid-life crisis, economists represent this trajectory with an inverted U-curve (for those who aren’t mathematically inclined, such as me, this is shaped like a “frowny face”). This pattern has been long known to psychologists, philosophers, and mystics, but Blanchflower found the exact age when the average midlife crisis peaks: 48, give or take a year depending on some conditions. “The curve’s trajectory holds true in countries where the median wage is high and where it is not, and where people tend to live longer and where they don’t,” he writes. The good news is that, according to science, things indeed get better. After age 48, people slowly start to find contentment.\n\nWhy is this? Some suggest this statistical pattern is hardwired into our biology. [A 2012 study of chimpanzees and orangutans](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/scientists-say-chimps-and-orangutans-have-mid-life-crises-136191276/)\n found that our closest evolutionary ancestors also fall into middle-aged ruts. Theirs tends to peak at the age of 30, which closely traces along the human timeline (a little past the midway point for life expectancy). The study’s methodology, however, is questionable at best. Accurately measuring happiness in humans is notoriously tricky, so you can only imagine what it’s like for great apes. “Each ape has several keepers, and every keeper was asked to assess the psychological well-being of their particular animal using a short questionnaire,” explains co-author Andrew Oswald. Among the questions, keepers had to answer: “If you were that animal, how happy do you think you would be on a scale of 1-7?” (I found this question to be so hilarious, it briefly relieved me from my miserable existence).\n\nEconomists don’t yet know why life gets better after age 48, but they have a few ideas. It could be that people learn to quell their unreasonable aspirations after mid-life, as well as adapt to their strengths and weaknesses. They may learn to compare themselves less to others or appreciate their remaining years as similar-aged peers pass on. A more straightforward explanation could be that the population sample at the end of the age spectrum is biased. Happier people tend to live longer, so the inverted U-curve simply reflects who has managed to stick around.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/114a0ba713573d6d891845fa2bfa3b4b/d4c1523bd533f41c-1e/s540x810/8dd0c9045f6ac77107ee27335d450da8a40ab547.jpg)\n\nAnother theory is that we learn how to live with our mistakes. When we’re young, many of us expect to eventually achieve perfection in various areas of adulthood. We imagine ourselves one day being in a happy and harmonious marriage, owning a home, earning the respect of our peers, and being engaged in deeply fulfilling work. But the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry. Somewhere along the way, cracks and fissures start to appear in our plans, and small decisions compounded over time have a way of taking us to unexpected places. It’s then that we begin to ruminate over the “what ifs.” What if I had done this and not done that? Most of all, what if my life turned out differently?\n\nAs I’ve gotten older, I’ve found that it’s easy to spiral into regret. You start to ruminate over what you did or did not do, and suddenly all your failures come into full relief. [A psychology study at UC Berkeley found that](https://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Zhang_2016.pdf)\n, when those moments happen, you can learn and grow from mistakes by facing them directly with some self-compassion. “Regrets are common,” writes psychology professors Jia Wei Zhang and Serena Chen. “Instead of wishing to go back to un-do or do, what people can do right now is confront these regretted life experiences with self-compassion, paving the way for personal improvement.” It helps to situate one’s shortcomings as part of the common human experience. To fail is to live a fuller life.\n\nThis is easier said than done, of course, but perhaps that’s why older people are more content. The movie cliche, “I wish things could just go back to the way they were,” suggests that we should be able to move onto good times, but as though the bad times never happened. Maybe as you get older, you learn how to embrace, rather than trying to erase, those memories.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9fa0bf1784f59c851a81b3474865760f/d4c1523bd533f41c-70/s540x810/00b1ecd94466e01196d9e748a20ae3d7c4a8f096.jpg)\n\n[Kei Shigenaga](https://keishigenaga.com/)\n, a relatively new jewelry label based in Japan, represents some of these ideas through finely crafted accessories. The label was started a few years ago by two friends who met in New York City. Wataru Shimosato, a thin, long-haired Japanese model with a talent for photography, serves as the company’s creative director. Then there’s Kei Shigenaga, the company’s namesake and silversmith, who makes all of the jewelry by hand in his Tokyo-based studio.\n\nEven though these are glimmering, shiny pieces rendered in sterling silver or gold, Kei Shigenaga’s jewelry pieces feel dark and brooding. There’s a running tension between the image of fine jewelry as being something delicate here, but also tough. “Jewelry isn’t just about fashion, it can also be an art object that you can have with you every day,” the Japanese silversmith once told [Eugene Rabkin at StyleZeitgeist](https://www.sz-mag.com/news/2018/06/introducing-kei-shigenaga-jewelry/)\n. “In my work, I try to concentrate on the roughness of precious metals.”\n\nFor his designs, Shigenaga takes inspiration from traditional Japanese culture. The twin, sterling silver pendants on his [Ryu necklace](https://keishigenaga.com/collections/all-items/products/ryu-necklace)\n, which almost look like liquid silver droplets, represent the two carps in Japanese lore. According to legend, a school of fish was swimming up the Yellow River one day when they approached a waterfall. When the current started to get too rough, most of them turned back. But two koi fish remained and spent the next hundred years trying to swim up the cliff. At last, when they reached the top, the Gods turned these two spiraling carps into a beautiful golden dragon. [That’s why koi fish are used in Japanese tattooing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl8Be7_E1vM)\n to represent strength, independence, and perseverance. It’s said that their nature is to swim upstream.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a2ab80a6b451ecb7d2def5347eb291a0/d4c1523bd533f41c-d4/s540x810/1b76e1d55800785ff3f8ac848d2ddd69a3ac2d96.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f747abe6899fc9b905035bf710950f03/d4c1523bd533f41c-59/s540x810/305eda82f0df15e443b222943f414b598ceb8b12.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cafa93eb5b080d2ddd97ef95316265a5/d4c1523bd533f41c-5d/s540x810/f51648642a6b2b82c1e8b03611420032bf80c98c.png)\n\nIn the last year or so, Shigenaga has been inspired by _kintsugi_, the Japanese art of repairing broken ceramics with a gold-peppered lacquer. The method supposedly dates back to the Muromachi period when 15th-century Japanese shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa accidentally broke his favorite tea bowl. He sent the broken ceramic pieces back to China for repair, but upon the bowl’s return, Yoshimasa was horrified with how the shards had been affixed together using ugly metal staples. So he tasked his local craftsmen with finding a more aesthetically pleasing solution. The method they came up with was later known as _kintsugi_ – _kin_ meaning golden, _tsugi_ for joinery. Instead of trying to disguise the fault lines and render them invisible, these craftspeople made something artful out of the broken pieces by gluing them together using a golden lacquer.\n\nAs a philosophy, _kintsugi_ can be seen as part of the broader Japanese tradition of _wabi-sabi_, which cherishes that which is simple, unpretentious, and old. This idea, which underscores some themes in Zen Buddhism, says that old, weathered items shouldn’t be neglected or discarded, but valued and repaired with enormous care. _Kintsugi_ is also similar to the Japanese idea of _mushin_, or “no mind,” which carries connotations of “fully existing within the moment, of non-attachment, of equanimity amid changing conditions, of removal from the desire to impose one’s will upon the world.” In her essay “A Tearoom View of Mended Ceramics,” published in the anthology _[Flickwerk](http://annacolibri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Flickwerk_The_Aesthetics_of_Mended_Japanese_Ceramics.pdf)\n_, Christy Bartlett writes about the philosophy behind Japanese ceramics:\n\n> Mended ceramics foremost convey a sense of the passage of time. The vicissitudes of existence over time, to which all humans are susceptible, could not be clearer than in the breaks, the knocks, and the shattering to which ceramic ware too is subject. \\[…\\] Mended ceramics convey simultaneously a sense of rupture and of continuity. That one moment in which the incident occurred is forever captured in the lines and fields of lacquer mending. It becomes an eternally present moment yet a moment that oddly enough segues into another where perishability is circumvented by repair. Simultaneously we have the expression of frailty and of resilience, life before the incident and life after. Yet the object is not the same. In its rebirth, it assumes a new identity that incorporates yet transcends the previous identity. Like the cycle of reincarnation, one life draws to a close and another begins.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2014b2d2087b44450d47c0bba47a2180/d4c1523bd533f41c-dd/s540x810/6558863d4e0a408c3256cb0f988aa4eddf6ab067.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6df78b0d59d6bcc91ba5a84a9c5dce7a/d4c1523bd533f41c-f5/s540x810/fb4100d9544ec1d425ab13ab005294a7eab5d89a.jpg)\n\nShigenaga’s jewelry isn’t literally broken and then repaired with _kintsugi_, but the company makes their rings, bangles, and even hair ties to mimic the aesthetic. Fault lines are built into the sterling silver pieces, and then molten 18k gold is poured into the cracks. If I had one criticism, it would be that it can be hard to spot the contrasting gold lines at first. The detailing is faint and subtle, but on the upside, this also makes it easier to match metals in an outfit. And, perhaps, it would be missing the point if you were to insist on perfection from a _kintsugi_\\-inspired object.\n\nThere is, of course, the argument that, like pre-distressed clothing, _kintsugi_ jewelry mistakes the aesthetic for substance. Since _kintsugi’s_ introduction 600 years ago, Japanese craftsmen have been accused of purposely breaking ceramics, repairing them with gold, and selling the objects to elites who are hungry for commitment-free spirituality. Admittedly, there’s also something mawkishly sentimental about the symbolism. But in an age that values youth and perfection, the art of _kintsugi_ says we should value that which is scarred, broken, or imperfect, starting with ourselves and those around us. I like Kei Shigenaga’s jewelry as a reminder of that wisdom. \n\nLast year, I bought one of their [chunky Koryu rings](https://rstyle.me/+qedkmkpH68hRnlCxCRL8ew)\n on a whim and I’ve been surprised by how often I reach for it. The style naturally goes with brooding contemporary lines such as [Lemaire](https://rstyle.me/+zophG9PHnjT5_YCM0PAvWQ)\n, [Robert Geller](http://www.robertgeller-ny.com/)\n, and [Stephen Schneider](https://bit.ly/2RiLS6Z)\n. I also find that it fits right in with Western-styled workwear, such as a [suede trucker jacket](https://therake.com/barbanera-dark-brown-suede-ennio-trucker-jacket.html)\n worn with a [corded Western shirt](https://therake.com/barbanera-black-fdp-italian-corduroy-shirt.html)\n and [some slim jeans](https://standardandstrange.com/collections/circle-of-friends-studio)\n. So long as the outfit has a bit of an edge – more [Nine Lives](https://standardandstrange.com/collections/nine-lives)\n or [Margiela’s five zip](https://rstyle.me/+BwyCCCC_ly3qf06t--bqtg)\n, rather than a [navy sport coat](https://bit.ly/36fEnBT)\n worn with [grey flannel trousers](https://bit.ly/2GhTvnH)\n – I think these rings make for a nice finishing touch. \n\nKei Shigenaga’s jewelry used to only be available through made-to-order, which meant that all sales were final. In the last few months, a couple of stores have picked them up as part of their stocked inventory. This makes it infinitely easier to figure out your size, as well as return things if you decide you don’t like how the pieces look on you. You can find a selection of their jewelry at [SSENSE](https://rstyle.me/+m4ydDSTrJJauwKtFo5AANQ)\n and [Self Edge](https://www.selfedge.com/)\n. At the moment, Self Edge only carries two of the models in-store, the Kyo and Shisui. However, Kiya tells me they’re getting more shipments later this season and they’ll be online soon. I’ve been thinking about buying the battered, blank signet ring that Kei Shigenaga calls their [Kyoka](https://rstyle.me/+2QTQiAeaqe40DKG_Zia5Jw)\n. It can be dicey to wear multiple rings on one hand, but Kei Shigenaga’s designs, as evidenced by the photos below, are perfect for this kind of thing. \n\nFor more of Kei Shigenaga, you can find them on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/keishigenaga/)\n and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Kei+Shigenaga)\n.

Note, the actual sales section isn’t up yet — and things will be added to the promotion as the night rolls on. But if you add things to your cart now, you may see some discounted prices. \n\nFor those unfamiliar, Mr. Porter’s seasonal sale rolls out in waves. By the end of tonight, you’ll see the official sales section up. And by tomorrow morning, you’ll see the full scope of their sale. If you want to get the best size selection, however, now is a good time to browse. Add things to your cart to see if they’ve already been discounted. If not, leave them in your cart and check back to see if they’re included in the promotion. If you see multiple items you want, checkout now with the discounted pieces you like. Things tend to move quickly at Mr. Porter and your size may not be around by tomorrow. \n\nI think the best way to browse the sale is by searching through the product categories and filtering by sizes. That way, you increase your chance of stumbling upon something serendipitously. [Mr. Porter also has a page on their site listing all their brands](https://rstyle.me/+V1MLZOACq3gqTx9W2J_dtQ)\n. If you’re looking for suggestions, however, here are ten items I think are particularly good. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/397594c6ba37f8e01fdd40f297324fa9/b0c4e0390ddb1b7e-f3/s540x810/09cb83c035521f543a5d3ef84ef2b4ea93ac94fc.png)\n\n**[Ten C Shearling Liner ($645)](https://rstyle.me/+zcoqKp06I7bn57YvEGy0oQ)\n**\n\n[This is supposed to be a modular liner for Ten C’s coats](https://rstyle.me/+zcoqKp06I7bn57YvEGy0oQ)\n. You buy one of these in your regular size, then put it into any one of Ten C’s coats for added insulation. But truthfully, I wear the liner as a standalone piece more than my actual Ten C outerwear. It looks good with jeans or fatigues and isn’t overly bulky (I mean, it’s a liner). I also like that it looks a bit directional, but is basic enough to go with everyday workwear. [I’ve written about my love for this piece before](https://dieworkwear.com/post/139611091284/get-in-liner)\n (mine is an older version). I was also pleasantly surprised to see that Aaron Levine, the Creative Director at Abercrombie & Fitch, [wears it the same way](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5K4SUjgLdc/)\n. I think he looks great. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/862d1e70638685c423bfe95f5d6bd4d2/b0c4e0390ddb1b7e-25/s540x810/c1b70968f4ba23042c8c214d72bfa65df02bb650.png)\n\n**[RRL Cargo Pants  ($182)](https://rstyle.me/+BAHldGnh7w1Zmc927HMX1Q)\n**\n\nCargo pants have a bad rap, not undeserved. They’re the symbol of frat bros, ravers, and the sort of people who carry vape pens, tactical knives, and Soundgarden CDs on their body. Over the last year, however, I’ve come to appreciate how they can help create a more unique silhouette. Articulated knees, box pleated pockets, and drawstring hems can all help to create a more interesting shape on the bottom half of your outfit, which can really bring a look into its own. [I have a pair from RRL](https://rstyle.me/+BAHldGnh7w1Zmc927HMX1Q)\n that I wear with Western denim shirts, ranch jackets, and black double riders. [See this old post for some outfit inspiration](https://dieworkwear.com/post/182991405299/the-much-maligned-cargo-pant)\n. [Andrew Chen of 3sixteen](https://dieworkwear.com/post/183282383729/a-relatable-casual-uniform)\n also wears a pair from his own brand with things such as Cowichan sweaters. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b5393f93d27d5b0e6837dc10ce5d5315/b0c4e0390ddb1b7e-65/s540x810/513442c3a4417ee0eeb2a077834ce5efb52cbc0a.png)\n\n**[Howlin Cream Cable Knit ($210)](https://rstyle.me/+6-wclm-RhgpfaFXOYH6Ygw)\n**\n\nA cream cable knit is one of those genuinely useful items that fits into almost any wardrobe. It adds texture and visual interest, has classic roots but remains modern, and does the good work of keeping you warm. [This one is from Howlin](https://rstyle.me/+6-wclm-RhgpfaFXOYH6Ygw)\n, an Antwerp knitwear brand that relies on Scottish and Irish manufacturers (the company’s name is taken from the Scottish slang for smelly). Howlin’s sweaters are a little slimmer and more contemporary than traditional designs, but they fit reasonably easy. I like them for how well they ride the line between playful and classic.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a197e11bfd0aaf821bcc4a30621d686f/b0c4e0390ddb1b7e-d6/s540x810/72eefcc40bec7378b27a0d9749a8f9b92664b6c5.png)\n\n**[Private White VC Shearling Trimmed Bomber ($556)](https://rstyle.me/+r8A6VzGWWmfQDprGfzoAnQ)\n**\n\nPrivate White VC is wonderful for casualwear if you normally find yourself in suits and sport coats. They do classic outerwear with upgraded materials and trims. [This navy bomber is made from midweight wool](https://rstyle.me/+r8A6VzGWWmfQDprGfzoAnQ)\n and features a two-way rose metal zipper, spacious hip pockets, and most importantly, a handsome black shearling collar. The style is a bit basic, yes, but also the sort of thing that would go well in a wardrobe mostly comprised of soft-shouldered tailoring. Wear it with slim jeans, textured knitwear, and pebble-grained chukkas. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd9fe78acc1f7b8f7430ec1d344d1e00/b0c4e0390ddb1b7e-a0/s540x810/e88f4b4be8177a5a531dcf24fb1c0e3a5b38b668.jpg)\n\n**[Drake’s Donegal Beanie ($48)](https://rstyle.me/+YrzwoqnefheyCwP1yQA1aw)\n**\n\nI’m not proud that I wear beanies – and frankly, I’m not even sure I look good in a hat. But as a purely practical matter, they’re useful when I’m running out of the house and don’t have time to do my hair. Drake’s are really nice if your casualwear leans classic. Theirs are knitted in Scotland from 100% wool, come in [speckled Donegal](https://rstyle.me/+YrzwoqnefheyCwP1yQA1aw)\n and [cable-knit designs](https://rstyle.me/+VrJ3wrocu9PdZOuEqQNP2g)\n, and are sized well. The photo above is from Drake’s site, not Mr. Porter, but I’m including it here because Jason Jules is one damn handsome human being.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a2c48ae3001fbc68a5bc0689d678feb/b0c4e0390ddb1b7e-5e/s540x810/9bdfc055a5920ae84f044e14a6f42859f228b3af.png)\n\n**[Drake’s Casentino Pullover ($447)](https://rstyle.me/+jb4cjEQ9A1cfm2cw_v1Xxw)** \n\n[I dig this Casentino pullover from Drake’s this season](https://rstyle.me/+jb4cjEQ9A1cfm2cw_v1Xxw)\n. The design is inspired by an old Boston running club jacket that Drake’s Creative Director Michael Hill has worn for years. It’s sporty, so a little outside of Drake’s usual wheelhouse. But it’s fun, cheery, and weaves in a bit of tailored clothing history with that Casentino cloth (originally an overcoat fabric worn by Florentine monks and later aristocrats). The fabric is overcoating weight, which means it should function as a proper piece of outerwear. At the same time, it looks like the perfect casual thing to wear with jeans when going to the cafe in the morning. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/43ea6ea68b960e23354ac7e2ed9abc5d/b0c4e0390ddb1b7e-f8/s540x810/500c22cc6f4891421e361302683ae1d4bceeb261.png)\n\n**[Mr. P Alpaca Coat ($595)](https://rstyle.me/+vccz-NUoNvwaCrpG9vrXDQ)\n**\n\n[This overcoat from Mr. P](https://rstyle.me/+vccz-NUoNvwaCrpG9vrXDQ)\n, which is Mr. Porter’s house line, checks all the boxes on the coveted menswear bingo card. It’s oversized. It’s textured. And it’s on sale. The long lapel makes this coat better suited to fall, rather than blustery winters since it’ll leave your chest exposed unless you wear a scarf.

You don’t have to wear it with Chelsea boots and skinny jeans. A double rider can be worn with a chunky turtleneck, slim-straight denim, and just a regular pair of work boots. [I believe the version at Mr. Porter is Schott’s 618](https://rstyle.me/+EVIaexRFi7XzwLCo3JFfUg)\n, which is slimmer than the version they produce for motorcycle riders, but not as long as their other fashion model.

Yes, they’re traditionally worn by older men, but that’s also the reason why anyone can wear them. Whether you’re 30 or 60, into traditional American style or something more contemporary, tassel loafers can work so long as you know how to incorporate them into your wardrobe. It’s about either playing to or against the social stereotype. I like them with sport coats and button-down collars, but you can also wear them more casually with jeans and a sweater.

Note, the actual sales section isn’t up yet — and things will be added to the promotion as the night rolls on. But if you add things to your cart now, you may see some discounted prices. \n\nFor those unfamiliar, Mr. Porter’s seasonal sale rolls out in waves. By the end of tonight, you’ll see the official sales section up. And by tomorrow morning, you’ll see the full scope of their sale. If you want to get the best size selection, however, now is a good time to browse. Add things to your cart to see if they’ve already been discounted. If not, leave them in your cart and check back to see if they’re included in the promotion. If you see multiple items you want, checkout now with the discounted pieces you like. Things tend to move quickly at Mr. Porter and your size may not be around by tomorrow. \n\nI think the best way to browse the sale is by searching through the product categories and filtering by sizes. That way, you increase your chance of stumbling upon something serendipitously. [Mr. Porter also has a page on their site listing all their brands](https://rstyle.me/+V1MLZOACq3gqTx9W2J_dtQ)\n. If you’re looking for suggestions, however, here are ten items I think are particularly good. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/397594c6ba37f8e01fdd40f297324fa9/b0c4e0390ddb1b7e-f3/s540x810/09cb83c035521f543a5d3ef84ef2b4ea93ac94fc.png)\n\n**[Ten C Shearling Liner ($645)](https://rstyle.me/+zcoqKp06I7bn57YvEGy0oQ)\n**\n\n[This is supposed to be a modular liner for Ten C’s coats](https://rstyle.me/+zcoqKp06I7bn57YvEGy0oQ)\n. You buy one of these in your regular size, then put it into any one of Ten C’s coats for added insulation. But truthfully, I wear the liner as a standalone piece more than my actual Ten C outerwear. It looks good with jeans or fatigues and isn’t overly bulky (I mean, it’s a liner). I also like that it looks a bit directional, but is basic enough to go with everyday workwear. [I’ve written about my love for this piece before](https://dieworkwear.com/post/139611091284/get-in-liner)\n (mine is an older version). I was also pleasantly surprised to see that Aaron Levine, the Creative Director at Abercrombie & Fitch, [wears it the same way](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5K4SUjgLdc/)\n.

They’re the symbol of frat bros, ravers, and the sort of people who carry vape pens, tactical knives, and Soundgarden CDs on their body. Over the last year, however, I’ve come to appreciate how they can help create a more unique silhouette. Articulated knees, box pleated pockets, and drawstring hems can all help to create a more interesting shape on the bottom half of your outfit, which can really bring a look into its own. [I have a pair from RRL](https://rstyle.me/+BAHldGnh7w1Zmc927HMX1Q)\n that I wear with Western denim shirts, ranch jackets, and black double riders.

It adds texture and visual interest, has classic roots but remains modern, and does the good work of keeping you warm. [This one is from Howlin](https://rstyle.me/+6-wclm-RhgpfaFXOYH6Ygw)\n, an Antwerp knitwear brand that relies on Scottish and Irish manufacturers (the company’s name is taken from the Scottish slang for smelly). Howlin’s sweaters are a little slimmer and more contemporary than traditional designs, but they fit reasonably easy. I like them for how well they ride the line between playful and classic.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a197e11bfd0aaf821bcc4a30621d686f/b0c4e0390ddb1b7e-d6/s540x810/72eefcc40bec7378b27a0d9749a8f9b92664b6c5.png)\n\n**[Private White VC Shearling Trimmed Bomber ($556)](https://rstyle.me/+r8A6VzGWWmfQDprGfzoAnQ)\n**\n\nPrivate White VC is wonderful for casualwear if you normally find yourself in suits and sport coats.

[This navy bomber is made from midweight wool](https://rstyle.me/+r8A6VzGWWmfQDprGfzoAnQ)\n and features a two-way rose metal zipper, spacious hip pockets, and most importantly, a handsome black shearling collar. The style is a bit basic, yes, but also the sort of thing that would go well in a wardrobe mostly comprised of soft-shouldered tailoring. Wear it with slim jeans, textured knitwear, and pebble-grained chukkas. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd9fe78acc1f7b8f7430ec1d344d1e00/b0c4e0390ddb1b7e-a0/s540x810/e88f4b4be8177a5a531dcf24fb1c0e3a5b38b668.jpg)\n\n**[Drake’s Donegal Beanie ($48)](https://rstyle.me/+YrzwoqnefheyCwP1yQA1aw)\n**\n\nI’m not proud that I wear beanies – and frankly, I’m not even sure I look good in a hat. But as a purely practical matter, they’re useful when I’m running out of the house and don’t have time to do my hair. Drake’s are really nice if your casualwear leans classic. Theirs are knitted in Scotland from 100% wool, come in [speckled Donegal](https://rstyle.me/+YrzwoqnefheyCwP1yQA1aw)\n and [cable-knit designs](https://rstyle.me/+VrJ3wrocu9PdZOuEqQNP2g)\n, and are sized well.

The design is inspired by an old Boston running club jacket that Drake’s Creative Director Michael Hill has worn for years. It’s sporty, so a little outside of Drake’s usual wheelhouse. But it’s fun, cheery, and weaves in a bit of tailored clothing history with that Casentino cloth (originally an overcoat fabric worn by Florentine monks and later aristocrats). The fabric is overcoating weight, which means it should function as a proper piece of outerwear. At the same time, it looks like the perfect casual thing to wear with jeans when going to the cafe in the morning. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/43ea6ea68b960e23354ac7e2ed9abc5d/b0c4e0390ddb1b7e-f8/s540x810/500c22cc6f4891421e361302683ae1d4bceeb261.png)\n\n**[Mr. P Alpaca Coat ($595)](https://rstyle.me/+vccz-NUoNvwaCrpG9vrXDQ)\n**\n\n[This overcoat from Mr. P](https://rstyle.me/+vccz-NUoNvwaCrpG9vrXDQ)\n, which is Mr. Porter’s house line, checks all the boxes on the coveted menswear bingo card.

We know the image still had the power to shock because the editors assuaged anxious readers by saying that, while pants were considered masculine at the time, they can still be worn in conventionally feminine ways. “If people accuse you of aping men, take no notice,” they wrote encouragingly. “Our new slacks are irreproachably masculine in their tailoring, but women have made them entirely their own by the colors in which they order them, and the accessories they add.” In the photo, the woman was shown wearing a pair of ochre-colored sharkskin trousers with delicate jewelry, Moroccan slippers, and a scarlet jersey shirt with a plunging neckline. A silk scarf was wrapped around her head like a turban, with a turquoise encrusted pin holding everything together.\n\nSince that cover was published, women have adopted nearly every masculine symbol into their wardrobe, from blue jeans to bomber jackets. But examples of men imitating women’s dress are rare. When they do, they’ll counter criticism by citing men’s earlier use of the style. [A belted robe coat](https://bit.ly/2sKhKaw)\n isn’t something your aunt would wear, but rather a reference to the earliest iteration of a polo coat, as seen on the [strong-shouldered Richard Gere](https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdudenbqvj1rf1jvro1_1280.jpg)\n. [Cuban heeled Chelsea boots](https://rstyle.me/+KV3uLY0IoScE0sa9SBl_eg)\n aren’t so much high-heeled as they are [Beatles-esque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatle_boot)\n. And when long-haired youths were criticized for their appearance in the late 1960s, they pointed to how Jesus is often depicted with shoulder-length locks.\n\n[Kenji Kaga](https://www.instagram.com/kaga4126/?hl=en)\n, the silver fox behind [Tie Your Tie](https://bit.ly/2r5zMnk)\n, has no problem telling you that he’s inspired by femininity — and he’ll do so without qualification. When I talked to him last month, I didn’t get the impression that he was saying so for political reasons. Instead, as an aesthete, it didn’t occur to him why he should do otherwise. “Most ties today come in stripes or small geometrics, such as the ones you might find at [E. Marinella](https://therake.com/brands/e-marinella.html)\n or [Drake’s](https://rstyle.me/+z5ZPm0PW6EBnSdUMPnc-6A)\n,” Kaga tells me. “Ours are inspired by vintage designs from the turn of the century until about the 1930s. I’m most inspired by French design, which I like for its femininity. The lines are more fluid and romantic; the design less symmetrical. When we color our collections, I also take inspiration from women’s collections, such as [Saint Laurent](https://rstyle.me/+hNcwYSJzydDRTeqWum-QFw)\n, [Celine](https://www.celine.com/)\n, and [Valentino](https://www.valentino.com/en-us)\n. Very old designs, but in new colors. This is our style.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/138997393001d5a7ed477e55deb3d606/eecd6a4712aee265-27/s540x810/ae2e1883f5eeb6f0c8e779b1d2ffd7d109776af4.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2e815d6f160cf37049b3dcb2a517bdea/eecd6a4712aee265-62/s540x810/2475c9beaeed7aec3b7ba9d186b9df445a070253.jpg)\n\nAs more men elect to wear ties for fashion, rather than respectability, the neckwear market has paradoxically become more conservative and uniform. Today, you can find a bazillion options for tasteful regimental stripes and foulards, which have their roots in traditional notions of masculine etiquette. Regimental stripes, for instance, originated in the early 20th century, when decommissioned British officers wanted to continue wearing their regimental colors after they returned to civilian life. Hence, we get the term “regimental silks” for how those colors denoted those officers’ service to their country. After a while, the practice was taken up by men in exclusive clubs or colleges, such as the students of Trinity College wearing navy and white stripes, or members of the Hawks Club wearing red and yellow stripes. Supposedly, when Anglophile Americans imitated the style, they switched the direction of the lines — slanting downward from right to left, rather than the reverse — so they wouldn’t be accused of being parvenus.\n\nBut the market for neckwear in the early 20th century was also a lot more diverse than it is today, and it wasn’t as challenging to find more expressive designs. Some years ago, [I visited Cilento](https://journal.styleforum.net/a-visit-to-cilento-naples/)\n, the oldest men’s shop in Naples, Italy. The store carries the sort of trad clothing you might expect at [J. Press](https://jpressonline.com/)\n or [The Andover Shop](https://theandovershop.com/)\n — waxed cotton coats with Shetland tweeds and square waisted brogues, along with bucket hats hanging next to surcingle belts. But what really sets it apart is the small studio above the tie store. \n\nGo through the back, up the stairs, disappear through another set of doors, and you’ll suddenly feel like time has stopped. Here, a collection of objects from the company’s 232-year history is spread through five or six rooms. Counters and shelves are stacked with old woolens and leather shoes; beautiful early 20th-century furniture, paintings, and prints surround the floor space; and original receipts from the family’s previous business in the shipping industry are kept in a protective case. There are also forgotten artifacts, such as an old trouser press and sample silk swatches designed for custom ties in the 1930s. Among the swatches are Old World motifs that look so foreign to our modern eye, it’s hard to find words to describe their patterns.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b59f683ed9ce9a6349f172460863dfe/eecd6a4712aee265-c1/s540x810/ff0c67a8e9ee16b110bafaa4192b2b2d702610f5.jpg)\n\nKaga has resurrected some of those designs through his company. Each season, he and his team make a pilgrimage to Como, Italy, one of the world’s centers for silk production and printing. They rummage through those printers’ archives, select designs they like, and then recolor them using schemes inspired by modern womenswear collections. Those materials are then sent back to their workshop, where they’re transformed into handmade accessories, including ties that have been hand-cut, hand-rolled, and handsewn. [I love this season’s tubular silk scarf](https://bit.ly/2ExwFHT)\n, which drapes like an evening scarf but can be worn with modern field jackets and black lambskin double riders. It features an Art Deco sunburst pattern and comes in a beautiful shade of navy and maroon – just the right hue to feel special.\n\nI’ve admired Kaga’s style for about ten years now, going back to when [Tommy Ton](https://www.instagram.com/tommyton/?hl=en)\n used to shoot photos of him outside of Pitti Uomo. His style can be described as Italian, but underneath is also a current of cosmopolitanism. [In interviews](https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/style/style-profile/03/02/19/a-tiemaker-schools-us-on-mens-fashion)\n, he’s said that he fell in love with fashion by way of American films. “I saw movies of Clark Gable, Cary Grant, and Frank Sinatra,” he says. “I’m inspired by my father, who admired American culture. He taught me about muscle cars, Muhammad Ali, and Sammy Davis Jr.” \n\nIn 1987, after having graduated from university, Kaga took his love for style and went into the menswear trade. His first gig was working as a distributor for an Italian shoe company, a job that afforded him a lot of time in Italy. One of his clients was Franco Minucci, the founder of the original Tie Your Tie shop in Florence, as well as the accompanying Sevenfold tie workshop. Later, Kaga lived in Paris for a year before eventually moving back home to Japan. In 1996, he opened the first Tie Your Tie franchise shop in Japan, “Tie Your Tie Aoyama,” located in Tokyo.\n\nI’m amused at how any time I think I’ve found something I believe is an unknown gem — an operation that hasn’t yet been endlessly written about — Kaga was there first. Some years ago, when I first stumbled upon [Sartoria Seminara](https://www.instagram.com/sartoriaseminara/?hl=en)\n, the tailor there told me that Kaga is an old friend. [Sartoria Marinaro?](https://dieworkwear.com/post/164801625674/that-old-smell-at-sartoria-marinaro)\n Yes, they know him too. And when Kentaro Nakagomi, founder of the Japanese outerwear label [Coherence](https://thearmoury.com/artisans/coherence)\n, told me about [Sartoria Vestrucci](https://dieworkwear.com/post/156454395739/the-other-florentine-look)\n, I tried to reach out to the Florentine tailor for an interview. Sadly, he said to me that he’s semi-retired now and not really open for business — he only cuts for old customers, such as Nakagomi and Kaga. (This was before Tomasso of Stefano Bemer convinced Loris to re-open as a [ready-to-wear shop with a bespoke service as a halo](https://www.permanentstyle.com/2017/07/sartoria-vestrucci-launches-bespoke-and-ready-to-wear-tailoring.html)\n). \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/42796f385ccbc869d9bffefe3999fcc3/eecd6a4712aee265-93/s540x810/3c1f442881eeea2627b9bda6950480f9ee6b2934.jpg)\n\nWhen I ask Kaga what he likes about Italian style, and in particular Florentine tailoring, he tells me it’s about the silhouette and comfort. “For me, tailoring has to be loose. Not English and perfect, but easy and comfortable,” he explains. “I’ve tried tailors in Milan and Naples, but Florence is my favorite because it sits somewhere in the middle. The shoulder is wider and straighter than what you see on Neapolitan coats, which tend to be rounder and narrower. At the same time, Florentine suits are very soft and comfortable. The waist also looks cleaner because they only use one underarm dart, whereas Neapolitan tailors use two extended front darts.”\n\nAs for his favorite items in his wardrobe, he rattles off from a mental list. Cashmere-silk and linen-blend sport coats in the summertime, then vintage Saxony tweeds in the winter. He loves his grey mohair suit and can’t imagine going without black oxfords. Among the many makers he’s tried, his favorite shoemaker is [Hidetaka Fukaya](https://www.permanentstyle.com/2013/01/hidetaka-fukaya-il-micio.html)\n, and his favorite tailors are [Seminara](https://www.instagram.com/sartoriaseminara/?hl=en)\n and [Corcos](https://dieworkwear.com/post/113434878889/a-japanese-italian-tailor)\n (notably, Kotaro Miyahira did his apprenticeship at Seminara). As for a personal style rule, Kaga says he almost always wears white high-count poplin shirts, not light blue. “Very important,” he says sternly. “Sometimes, I’ll wear white-and-blue striped shirts, but a white shirt gives you a good base for the jacket, tie, and trousers.”\n\nKaga is a man of broad sympathies and catholic tastes. His style has a point of view without being puritanical, and he draws from a variety of influences cultivated through his 32-year career in menswear. He appreciates vintage and modern, _prêt-à-porter_ and bespoke, masculine and feminine style, Italian tailoring and French design. “I believe in the value of coexistence,” [he once told The Armory](https://thearmoury.com/journal/10-questions-with-kenji-kaga)\n. “I think it’s important to have an open-minded attitude that accepts and accommodates different points of view. I respect and appreciate the old traditions, but at the same time, I am also very interested in what is happening in the new generation. Interacting with different kinds of people always inspires me to wonder, ‘if I were in his/her position, what would I be excited to have?’ I always search for new things with this question in my mind.” \n\n_You can find Tie Your Tie at [No Man Walks Alone](https://bit.ly/2r5zMnk)\n and [The Rake](https://therake.com/brands/tie-your-tie.html)\n (both sponsors on this site), [The Armoury](https://thearmoury.com/artisans/tie-your-tie)\n, [Barney’s](https://rstyle.me/+svBzKzyB4VJM69zq-CEBJw)\n, [Andrea Seoul](http://andreaseoul.com/product/list.html?cate_no=69)\n,_ _and [Bryceland’s](https://www.brycelandsco.com/collections/ties)\n.

hard to believe that it took until May 1939, the spring before the start of the Second World War, [for _Vogue_ to publish its first cover](https://cardiffbookhistory.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/may-1939_bath-fashion-museum.jpg)\n of a fashionable woman in trousers. We know the image still had the power to shock because the editors assuaged anxious readers by saying that, while pants were considered masculine at the time, they can still be worn in conventionally feminine ways. “If people accuse you of aping men, take no notice,” they wrote encouragingly. “Our new slacks are irreproachably masculine in their tailoring, but women have made them entirely their own by the colors in which they order them, and the accessories they add.” In the photo, the woman was shown wearing a pair of ochre-colored sharkskin trousers with delicate jewelry, Moroccan slippers, and a scarlet jersey shirt with a plunging neckline. A silk scarf was wrapped around her head like a turban, with a turquoise encrusted pin holding everything together.\n\nSince that cover was published, women have adopted nearly every masculine symbol into their wardrobe, from blue jeans to bomber jackets. But examples of men imitating women’s dress are rare. When they do, they’ll counter criticism by citing men’s earlier use of the style. [A belted robe coat](https://bit.ly/2sKhKaw)\n isn’t something your aunt would wear, but rather a reference to the earliest iteration of a polo coat, as seen on the [strong-shouldered Richard Gere](https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdudenbqvj1rf1jvro1_1280.jpg)\n. [Cuban heeled Chelsea boots](https://rstyle.me/+KV3uLY0IoScE0sa9SBl_eg)\n aren’t so much high-heeled as they are [Beatles-esque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatle_boot)\n. And when long-haired youths were criticized for their appearance in the late 1960s, they pointed to how Jesus is often depicted with shoulder-length locks.\n\n[Kenji Kaga](https://www.instagram.com/kaga4126/?hl=en)\n, the silver fox behind [Tie Your Tie](https://bit.ly/2r5zMnk)\n, has no problem telling you that he’s inspired by femininity — and he’ll do so without qualification. When I talked to him last month, I didn’t get the impression that he was saying so for political reasons. Instead, as an aesthete, it didn’t occur to him why he should do otherwise. “Most ties today come in stripes or small geometrics, such as the ones you might find at [E. Marinella](https://therake.com/brands/e-marinella.html)\n or [Drake’s](https://rstyle.me/+z5ZPm0PW6EBnSdUMPnc-6A)\n,” Kaga tells me. “Ours are inspired by vintage designs from the turn of the century until about the 1930s. I’m most inspired by French design, which I like for its femininity. The lines are more fluid and romantic; the design less symmetrical. When we color our collections, I also take inspiration from women’s collections, such as [Saint Laurent](https://rstyle.me/+hNcwYSJzydDRTeqWum-QFw)\n, [Celine](https://www.celine.com/)\n, and [Valentino](https://www.valentino.com/en-us)\n. Very old designs, but in new colors. This is our style.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/138997393001d5a7ed477e55deb3d606/eecd6a4712aee265-27/s540x810/ae2e1883f5eeb6f0c8e779b1d2ffd7d109776af4.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2e815d6f160cf37049b3dcb2a517bdea/eecd6a4712aee265-62/s540x810/2475c9beaeed7aec3b7ba9d186b9df445a070253.jpg)\n\nAs more men elect to wear ties for fashion, rather than respectability, the neckwear market has paradoxically become more conservative and uniform. Today, you can find a bazillion options for tasteful regimental stripes and foulards, which have their roots in traditional notions of masculine etiquette. Regimental stripes, for instance, originated in the early 20th century, when decommissioned British officers wanted to continue wearing their regimental colors after they returned to civilian life. Hence, we get the term “regimental silks” for how those colors denoted those officers’ service to their country. After a while, the practice was taken up by men in exclusive clubs or colleges, such as the students of Trinity College wearing navy and white stripes, or members of the Hawks Club wearing red and yellow stripes. Supposedly, when Anglophile Americans imitated the style, they switched the direction of the lines — slanting downward from right to left, rather than the reverse — so they wouldn’t be accused of being parvenus.\n\nBut the market for neckwear in the early 20th century was also a lot more diverse than it is today, and it wasn’t as challenging to find more expressive designs. Some years ago, [I visited Cilento](https://journal.styleforum.net/a-visit-to-cilento-naples/)\n, the oldest men’s shop in Naples, Italy. The store carries the sort of trad clothing you might expect at [J. Press](https://jpressonline.com/)\n or [The Andover Shop](https://theandovershop.com/)\n — waxed cotton coats with Shetland tweeds and square waisted brogues, along with bucket hats hanging next to surcingle belts. But what really sets it apart is the small studio above the tie store. \n\nGo through the back, up the stairs, disappear through another set of doors, and you’ll suddenly feel like time has stopped. Here, a collection of objects from the company’s 232-year history is spread through five or six rooms. Counters and shelves are stacked with old woolens and leather shoes; beautiful early 20th-century furniture, paintings, and prints surround the floor space; and original receipts from the family’s previous business in the shipping industry are kept in a protective case. There are also forgotten artifacts, such as an old trouser press and sample silk swatches designed for custom ties in the 1930s. Among the swatches are Old World motifs that look so foreign to our modern eye, it’s hard to find words to describe their patterns.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b59f683ed9ce9a6349f172460863dfe/eecd6a4712aee265-c1/s540x810/ff0c67a8e9ee16b110bafaa4192b2b2d702610f5.jpg)\n\nKaga has resurrected some of those designs through his company. Each season, he and his team make a pilgrimage to Como, Italy, one of the world’s centers for silk production and printing. They rummage through those printers’ archives, select designs they like, and then recolor them using schemes inspired by modern womenswear collections. Those materials are then sent back to their workshop, where they’re transformed into handmade accessories, including ties that have been hand-cut, hand-rolled, and handsewn. [I love this season’s tubular silk scarf](https://bit.ly/2ExwFHT)\n, which drapes like an evening scarf but can be worn with modern field jackets and black lambskin double riders. It features an Art Deco sunburst pattern and comes in a beautiful shade of navy and maroon – just the right hue to feel special.\n\nI’ve admired Kaga’s style for about ten years now, going back to when [Tommy Ton](https://www.instagram.com/tommyton/?hl=en)\n used to shoot photos of him outside of Pitti Uomo. His style can be described as Italian, but underneath is also a current of cosmopolitanism. [In interviews](https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/style/style-profile/03/02/19/a-tiemaker-schools-us-on-mens-fashion)\n, he’s said that he fell in love with fashion by way of American films. “I saw movies of Clark Gable, Cary Grant, and Frank Sinatra,” he says. “I’m inspired by my father, who admired American culture. He taught me about muscle cars, Muhammad Ali, and Sammy Davis Jr.” \n\nIn 1987, after having graduated from university, Kaga took his love for style and went into the menswear trade. His first gig was working as a distributor for an Italian shoe company, a job that afforded him a lot of time in Italy. One of his clients was Franco Minucci, the founder of the original Tie Your Tie shop in Florence, as well as the accompanying Sevenfold tie workshop. Later, Kaga lived in Paris for a year before eventually moving back home to Japan. In 1996, he opened the first Tie Your Tie franchise shop in Japan, “Tie Your Tie Aoyama,” located in Tokyo.\n\nI’m amused at how any time I think I’ve found something I believe is an unknown gem — an operation that hasn’t yet been endlessly written about — Kaga was there first. Some years ago, when I first stumbled upon [Sartoria Seminara](https://www.instagram.com/sartoriaseminara/?hl=en)\n, the tailor there told me that Kaga is an old friend. [Sartoria Marinaro?](https://dieworkwear.com/post/164801625674/that-old-smell-at-sartoria-marinaro)\n Yes, they know him too. And when Kentaro Nakagomi, founder of the Japanese outerwear label [Coherence](https://thearmoury.com/artisans/coherence)\n, told me about [Sartoria Vestrucci](https://dieworkwear.com/post/156454395739/the-other-florentine-look)\n, I tried to reach out to the Florentine tailor for an interview. Sadly, he said to me that he’s semi-retired now and not really open for business — he only cuts for old customers, such as Nakagomi and Kaga. (This was before Tomasso of Stefano Bemer convinced Loris to re-open as a [ready-to-wear shop with a bespoke service as a halo](https://www.permanentstyle.com/2017/07/sartoria-vestrucci-launches-bespoke-and-ready-to-wear-tailoring.html)\n). \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/42796f385ccbc869d9bffefe3999fcc3/eecd6a4712aee265-93/s540x810/3c1f442881eeea2627b9bda6950480f9ee6b2934.jpg)\n\nWhen I ask Kaga what he likes about Italian style, and in particular Florentine tailoring, he tells me it’s about the silhouette and comfort. “For me, tailoring has to be loose. Not English and perfect, but easy and comfortable,” he explains. “I’ve tried tailors in Milan and Naples, but Florence is my favorite because it sits somewhere in the middle. The shoulder is wider and straighter than what you see on Neapolitan coats, which tend to be rounder and narrower. At the same time, Florentine suits are very soft and comfortable. The waist also looks cleaner because they only use one underarm dart, whereas Neapolitan tailors use two extended front darts.”\n\nAs for his favorite items in his wardrobe, he rattles off from a mental list. Cashmere-silk and linen-blend sport coats in the summertime, then vintage Saxony tweeds in the winter. He loves his grey mohair suit and can’t imagine going without black oxfords. Among the many makers he’s tried, his favorite shoemaker is [Hidetaka Fukaya](https://www.permanentstyle.com/2013/01/hidetaka-fukaya-il-micio.html)\n, and his favorite tailors are [Seminara](https://www.instagram.com/sartoriaseminara/?hl=en)\n and [Corcos](https://dieworkwear.com/post/113434878889/a-japanese-italian-tailor)\n (notably, Kotaro Miyahira did his apprenticeship at Seminara). As for a personal style rule, Kaga says he almost always wears white high-count poplin shirts, not light blue. “Very important,” he says sternly. “Sometimes, I’ll wear white-and-blue striped shirts, but a white shirt gives you a good base for the jacket, tie, and trousers.”\n\nKaga is a man of broad sympathies and catholic tastes. His style has a point of view without being puritanical, and he draws from a variety of influences cultivated through his 32-year career in menswear. He appreciates vintage and modern, _prêt-à-porter_ and bespoke, masculine and feminine style, Italian tailoring and French design. “I believe in the value of coexistence,” [he once told The Armory](https://thearmoury.com/journal/10-questions-with-kenji-kaga)\n. “I think it’s important to have an open-minded attitude that accepts and accommodates different points of view. I respect and appreciate the old traditions, but at the same time, I am also very interested in what is happening in the new generation. Interacting with different kinds of people always inspires me to wonder, ‘if I were in his/her position, what would I be excited to have?’ I always search for new things with this question in my mind.” \n\n_You can find Tie Your Tie at [No Man Walks Alone](https://bit.ly/2r5zMnk)\n and [The Rake](https://therake.com/brands/tie-your-tie.html)\n (both sponsors on this site), [The Armoury](https://thearmoury.com/artisans/tie-your-tie)\n, [Barney’s](https://rstyle.me/+svBzKzyB4VJM69zq-CEBJw)\n, [Andrea Seoul](http://andreaseoul.com/product/list.html?cate_no=69)\n,_ _and [Bryceland’s](https://www.brycelandsco.com/collections/ties)\n.

[Over at Put This On](https://putthison.com/every-black-friday-sale-worth-seeing-2/)\n, we’re rounding up the best of Black Friday promotions. The list is massive, with the number of sales going into the hundreds, and we’ll be adding to the list over the weekend as we learn of new deals. For those who want something more manageable, [I’ve pulled together](https://dieworkwear.com/post/189313192624/nine-stellar-black-friday-sales)\n [some of my favorites in](https://dieworkwear.com/post/189327284734/mr-porters-sale-starts)\n [these three posts](https://dieworkwear.com/post/189354097654/stuff-i-bought-now-on-sale)\n.

For one, the company is a natural step-up for guys who love J. Crew. After all, Todd himself was once a designer at the brand and his company now occupies the physical space where J. Crew used to have their men’s flagship Liquor Store. I like his [long topcoats](https://rstyle.me/+TTYaiAdMo7cwQ0pzUaVuOg)\n, [suede jackets](https://rstyle.me/+wIrdvX476OWWk8D-LMmIug)\n, and [collab Champion sweats](https://rstyle.me/+X88wZ-c3FhY56kg_8LBpUw)\n. Todd Snyder’s prices are fair even at full retail, but they come down a little lower today with the checkout code BLACKFRIDAYNOW.\n\nBest of all, the code applies to their third party brands — and they have a great roster.

One of the things I like most about their operations is how there’s something for everyone –- from the more affordably priced Lof & Tung to premium, handwelted shoes by Saint Crispin’s. For Black Friday, they’ve put an assortment of their shoes and accessories on sale.\n\n[These handwelted Enzo Bonafe chukkas](https://www.skoaktiebolaget.com/collections/black-friday/products/enzo-bonafe-chukka-boot-hidro-volpe)\n, which are made with a studded Dainite outsole, are the sort of shoes you can wear most of the year.

Unlike other Cheleas, including those costing upwards of $1,500, these are made from a single piece of leather, so there’s no side seam below elasticated gusset. Naturally, [I also like the split toes](https://www.skoaktiebolaget.com/collections/black-friday/products/lof-tung-denham-espresso-country-calf)\n (a very handsome shape).

Things rarely get discounted more than 15%, and even then, those minor discounts only happen once a season. I suspect it’s because they don’t hold seasonal stock, and what they sell never goes out of style. Everyone today wears jeans, flannels, and t-shirts. Self Edge just sells better versions of those things.\n\nIf you’re just getting into raw denim, [I think 3sixteen’s SL-100x](https://www.selfedge.com/3sixteen?product_id=438)\n is a great starting place. It’s commonly recommended on denim boards because it’s a slim-straight cut that works well across a range of wardrobes and flatters many body types. The material is also woven in such a way that the jeans’ interior feels flannel soft — an unusual thing for raw denim. Additionally, I like Self Edge’s selection of [Lady White t-shirts](https://www.selfedge.com/lady-white-co)\n, [Iron Heart flannels](https://www.selfedge.com/iron-heart)\n, and [masculine jewelry](https://www.selfedge.com/jewelry)\n. I’ve been wearing [this ring](https://www.selfedge.com/jewelry?product_id=443)\n with workwear often. Buzz Rickson makes my [favorite marled grey sweatshirt](https://www.selfedge.com/sweaters-hoodies?product_id=1966)\n. If I had room in my closet for another leather jacket, I’d get the [Fine Creek double rider pictured above](https://www.selfedge.com/fine-creek-leathers?product_id=2220)\n. And I like these [fatigues from Stevenson Overall Company](https://www.selfedge.com/stevenson-overall-co?product_id=2441)\n.

The company was founded a few years ago by Sarah Ford, a San Angelo native, a former Marine, and a Harvard Business School grad. The company specializes in contemporary versions of work boots, namely military boots, Chelsea boots, and most of all, Western styles. The boots are Goodyear welted, made in Spain, and cut from full-grain leathers. They’re also reasonably priced around $350 to $400.\n\nI like how they combine casual styles with a traditional Goodyear welt construction. [They even have a black side zip](https://rstyle.me/+e19EPSK4g5w7W0P5fTe85w)\n, although it has a slight Western vibe. Pictured above are two of their more popular styles, the [Bexar](https://rstyle.me/+hm8RmvowP2PNU72gQNThMg)\n and [Gunner](https://rstyle.me/+4Vu2APitXqfRP281qHEo_A)\n. Being a pull-on boot means the shaft has to be a little larger to accommodate your foot going in. Supposedly, Ranch Road narrowed that shaft a little to give it a slimmer look — and to allow it to fit neatly under slimmer jeans. I assume that means it’ll take a little more work to pull your feet out, but I like how they look less rustic than [Red Wing’s Pecos](https://rstyle.me/+RQJNhv1PwmvwGU7lwhhV5A)\n. I’ve been wondering if they can pass for side-zips when worn. At $265 with the discount code, I’m tempted to see. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5984a6f38bc8474fa895dc618c914f1/1d671989375a7803-eb/s540x810/a18c47e720645155678a1260c3b637fde390d8d0.jpg)\n\n**[Proper Cloth:](https://propercloth.com/)\n 40% Off Select Custom Shirts  \n**\n\n[Proper Cloth](https://propercloth.com/)\n is a sponsor over at [Put This On](https://putthison.com/)\n, a site I work for, but I also think they’re one of the best online made-to-measure shirt companies. Of the eight or so MTM companies I’ve tried over the years, they’ve provided the best custom fit. They also have a great unfused button-down, which they call their Soft Ivy collar.  You can read reviews of their shirts over at [Menswear Musings](https://www.menswearmusings.com/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-proper-cloth-purchase/)\n and [From Squalor to Baller](https://fromsqualortoballer.com/review-proper-cloth-washed-denim/)\n.\n\nMost of all, I like how they can make casual shirts, which isn’t always possible with traditional custom shirtmakers. Bespoke tailors will have casual fabrics such as linen, needlecord, and wool-cotton blends. But they won’t have the kind of interesting textures and prints you can find at Proper Cloth (and certainly not Proper Cloth’s washed denim shirts, which are only possible through large group orders). For Black Friday, Proper Cloth has some of those causal shirtings discounted by as much as 40% off. I like the [ombre plaids](https://propercloth.com/dress-shirts/scarlet-and-black-ombre-plaid-flannel-256997.html)\n and [melange basketweaves](https://propercloth.com/dress-shirts/monti-navy-melange-basketweave-239176.html)\n. With prices starting at $75, these are an excellent value.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e27a02452cd478ee312723a637e9969b/1d671989375a7803-27/s540x810/70d645728c911fa6719cc00b784a0998e31b54f1.jpg)\n\n**[Uniqlo:](https://rstyle.me/+5FvIAT6OY_nto_WvChBfqw)\n Various Black Friday Specials**\n\nIn the US, fashion designs are famously not covered under intellectual property laws. You can’t legally protect the cut of a shirt, for example, or the design of a parka. Years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that clothes are too utilitarian — like spoons or hammers. So fashion companies have to find smart ways to protect their intellectual property.\n\n[Uniqlo](https://rstyle.me/+5FvIAT6OY_nto_WvChBfqw)\n gets around this by having special relationships within their supply chain. Instead of sourcing yarns from any old supplier, they’ve developed proprietary products in partnership with Toray Industries in Japan. Heattech is designed to keep you warm; Airism is designed to keep you cool. Those products are then patented as technologies.\n\nThey work pretty well, too. Since its introduction in 2003, Uniqlo has sold nearly 200 million units of their Heattech products. They come in tops, mufflers, hats, scarves, and even jeans. I mostly like the material in thin, stretchy baselayers, which you can wear under your clothes to keep warm. They’re not as insulating as heavy wool baselayers, but they’re more comfortable if you have to spend any time indoors. Along with their other Black Friday deals, [Uniqlo has Heattech baselayers today starting at $9.90](https://rstyle.me/+JyGjt4tjaHb6L1qnq2KfTw)\n.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/446339419c6a54be9f24e79f695c7406/1d671989375a7803-bd/s540x810/2d0686b23d9a356cfab4290f3454f129959f4172.jpg)\n\n**[Tommy John:](https://rstyle.me/+_xygdAiEsHeSKM9HFzqYyA)\n 25% Off Orders Over $100**\n\nA couple of years ago, I went searching for the world’s best underwear. The most embarrassing part of that process was me purchasing a pair of $150 boxer briefs from Zimmerli, a Swiss company commonly hailed as the best producer on classic men’s style boards. Those felt amazing at first, but they lost their softness over time. In the end, the best underwear I found was a pair of $34 boxer briefs from Tommy John, [which the company calls their Second Skin](https://rstyle.me/+_xygdAiEsHeSKM9HFzqYyA)\n.\n\nFirst, a word about cut. Boxer briefs are absolutely more comfortable than boxers, which give you no support at all. And they look better than regular briefs, which are bad for obvious reasons. Tommy John’s are excellent because they’re made from a non-pilling micro-modal blend. Micromodal is spun from wood pulp. It’s a type of rayon, not unlike the Bemberg that lines your suits. When mixed with Spandex, as it is here, it’s stretchy, comfortable, and silky. It also wicks sweat from the skin, feels oh so cool, and is much more breathable than cotton.\n\nPlenty of companies make micro-modal boxer briefs, but some pill over time, and others lose their softness. I imagine I’ll never find out what makes Tommy John’s material so perfect, but in the five or so years I’ve been wearing them, they’ve performed the best. Second Skin gives you support where you need, keeps you feeling dry, and has a “quick draw” opening that allows you to do your business. A few years ago, I threw out all my old underwear and just replaced them with Tommy John.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/509300ba1519f94850d443b37e717a71/1d671989375a7803-2e/s540x810/da2ccf4ee8eca51f32275a0d6640e6f55e3b1aed.jpg)\n\n**[Barneys New York:](https://rstyle.me/+zBjIVkKjEIjxBUe9WrTOYw)\n Closing Sale**\n\nAs you may have heard, Barney’s New York is shuttering and the company will soon [only live on as a licensed label at Saks Fifth Avenue](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/09/sunday-review/barneys-saks.html)\n. In the meantime, the company is holding its closing sale. The discounts so far are meager — less than what most other retailers are offering for Black Friday. I haven’t had time to trawl through the inventory, but I recently remembered that Barney’s carries my favorite fragrance: [Helmut Lang’s Curion](https://rstyle.me/+8xsLHirV54sGQFnnYAoz9g)\n. Initially created in 2002, the perfume was short-lived before it was taken off the shelves. But during the time it was on the market, it garnered praise from critics and eventually became sought after by collectors. In 2014, the company relaunched it — and it’s as good as I remember.\n\nCurion is a soft leather scent without any of the smokiness that can make old-world leathers, such as Knize’s, feel fusty and overpowering. It opens with bergamot, mandarin orange, and pink pepper, then almost immediately transitions into suede and carrot seed. In the end, you get a strangely alluring mix of cedar and musk — not an uncommon combination, but so comforting here. I wear mine with leather jackets and cold weather tailoring. It’s a modern leather scent for guys who don’t identify with that version of masculinity that involves big gold chains or piped tobacco. Find a sample of it first, if you can (never blind buy bottles). [Then remember it’s on sale at Barney’s](https://rstyle.me/+8xsLHirV54sGQFnnYAoz9g)\n.\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/887a89de9e4b1ec8292053c1b428c102/1d671989375a7803-93/s540x810/0e0e2337b856d7ce2033f99f4cf958a647fdb73b.jpg)\n\nEven when it’s online and you can shop from the comfort of your own home, Black Friday still feels like a mad dash to find the best deals.

For one, the company is a natural step-up for guys who love J. Crew. After all, Todd himself was once a designer at the brand and his company now occupies the physical space where J.

Things rarely get discounted more than 15%, and even then, those minor discounts only happen once a season. I suspect it’s because they don’t hold seasonal stock, and what they sell never goes out of style. Everyone today wears jeans, flannels, and t-shirts. Self Edge just sells better versions of those things.\n\nIf you’re just getting into raw denim, [I think 3sixteen’s SL-100x](https://www.selfedge.com/3sixteen?product_id=438)\n is a great starting place. It’s commonly recommended on denim boards because it’s a slim-straight cut that works well across a range of wardrobes and flatters many body types. The material is also woven in such a way that the jeans’ interior feels flannel soft — an unusual thing for raw denim. Additionally, I like Self Edge’s selection of [Lady White t-shirts](https://www.selfedge.com/lady-white-co)\n, [Iron Heart flannels](https://www.selfedge.com/iron-heart)\n, and [masculine jewelry](https://www.selfedge.com/jewelry)\n.

The company was founded a few years ago by Sarah Ford, a San Angelo native, a former Marine, and a Harvard Business School grad. The company specializes in contemporary versions of work boots, namely military boots, Chelsea boots, and most of all, Western styles. The boots are Goodyear welted, made in Spain, and cut from full-grain leathers. They’re also reasonably priced around $350 to $400.\n\nI like how they combine casual styles with a traditional Goodyear welt construction. [They even have a black side zip](https://rstyle.me/+e19EPSK4g5w7W0P5fTe85w)\n, although it has a slight Western vibe. Pictured above are two of their more popular styles, the [Bexar](https://rstyle.me/+hm8RmvowP2PNU72gQNThMg)\n and [Gunner](https://rstyle.me/+4Vu2APitXqfRP281qHEo_A)\n. Being a pull-on boot means the shaft has to be a little larger to accommodate your foot going in. Supposedly, Ranch Road narrowed that shaft a little to give it a slimmer look — and to allow it to fit neatly under slimmer jeans. I assume that means it’ll take a little more work to pull your feet out, but I like how they look less rustic than [Red Wing’s Pecos](https://rstyle.me/+RQJNhv1PwmvwGU7lwhhV5A)\n. I’ve been wondering if they can pass for side-zips when worn. At $265 with the discount code, I’m tempted to see. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5984a6f38bc8474fa895dc618c914f1/1d671989375a7803-eb/s540x810/a18c47e720645155678a1260c3b637fde390d8d0.jpg)\n\n**[Proper Cloth:](https://propercloth.com/)\n 40% Off Select Custom Shirts  \n**\n\n[Proper Cloth](https://propercloth.com/)\n is a sponsor over at [Put This On](https://putthison.com/)\n, a site I work for, but I also think they’re one of the best online made-to-measure shirt companies. Of the eight or so MTM companies I’ve tried over the years, they’ve provided the best custom fit. They also have a great unfused button-down, which they call their Soft Ivy collar.  You can read reviews of their shirts over at [Menswear Musings](https://www.menswearmusings.com/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-proper-cloth-purchase/)\n and [From Squalor to Baller](https://fromsqualortoballer.com/review-proper-cloth-washed-denim/)\n.\n\nMost of all, I like how they can make casual shirts, which isn’t always possible with traditional custom shirtmakers. Bespoke tailors will have casual fabrics such as linen, needlecord, and wool-cotton blends. But they won’t have the kind of interesting textures and prints you can find at Proper Cloth (and certainly not Proper Cloth’s washed denim shirts, which are only possible through large group orders). For Black Friday, Proper Cloth has some of those causal shirtings discounted by as much as 40% off. I like the [ombre plaids](https://propercloth.com/dress-shirts/scarlet-and-black-ombre-plaid-flannel-256997.html)\n and [melange basketweaves](https://propercloth.com/dress-shirts/monti-navy-melange-basketweave-239176.html)\n. With prices starting at $75, these are an excellent value.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e27a02452cd478ee312723a637e9969b/1d671989375a7803-27/s540x810/70d645728c911fa6719cc00b784a0998e31b54f1.jpg)\n\n**[Uniqlo:](https://rstyle.me/+5FvIAT6OY_nto_WvChBfqw)\n Various Black Friday Specials**\n\nIn the US, fashion designs are famously not covered under intellectual property laws. You can’t legally protect the cut of a shirt, for example, or the design of a parka. Years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that clothes are too utilitarian — like spoons or hammers. So fashion companies have to find smart ways to protect their intellectual property.\n\n[Uniqlo](https://rstyle.me/+5FvIAT6OY_nto_WvChBfqw)\n gets around this by having special relationships within their supply chain. Instead of sourcing yarns from any old supplier, they’ve developed proprietary products in partnership with Toray Industries in Japan. Heattech is designed to keep you warm; Airism is designed to keep you cool. Those products are then patented as technologies.\n\nThey work pretty well, too. Since its introduction in 2003, Uniqlo has sold nearly 200 million units of their Heattech products. They come in tops, mufflers, hats, scarves, and even jeans. I mostly like the material in thin, stretchy baselayers, which you can wear under your clothes to keep warm. They’re not as insulating as heavy wool baselayers, but they’re more comfortable if you have to spend any time indoors. Along with their other Black Friday deals, [Uniqlo has Heattech baselayers today starting at $9.90](https://rstyle.me/+JyGjt4tjaHb6L1qnq2KfTw)\n.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/446339419c6a54be9f24e79f695c7406/1d671989375a7803-bd/s540x810/2d0686b23d9a356cfab4290f3454f129959f4172.jpg)\n\n**[Tommy John:](https://rstyle.me/+_xygdAiEsHeSKM9HFzqYyA)\n 25% Off Orders Over $100**\n\nA couple of years ago, I went searching for the world’s best underwear. The most embarrassing part of that process was me purchasing a pair of $150 boxer briefs from Zimmerli, a Swiss company commonly hailed as the best producer on classic men’s style boards. Those felt amazing at first, but they lost their softness over time. In the end, the best underwear I found was a pair of $34 boxer briefs from Tommy John, [which the company calls their Second Skin](https://rstyle.me/+_xygdAiEsHeSKM9HFzqYyA)\n.\n\nFirst, a word about cut. Boxer briefs are absolutely more comfortable than boxers, which give you no support at all. And they look better than regular briefs, which are bad for obvious reasons. Tommy John’s are excellent because they’re made from a non-pilling micro-modal blend. Micromodal is spun from wood pulp. It’s a type of rayon, not unlike the Bemberg that lines your suits. When mixed with Spandex, as it is here, it’s stretchy, comfortable, and silky. It also wicks sweat from the skin, feels oh so cool, and is much more breathable than cotton.\n\nPlenty of companies make micro-modal boxer briefs, but some pill over time, and others lose their softness. I imagine I’ll never find out what makes Tommy John’s material so perfect, but in the five or so years I’ve been wearing them, they’ve performed the best. Second Skin gives you support where you need, keeps you feeling dry, and has a “quick draw” opening that allows you to do your business. A few years ago, I threw out all my old underwear and just replaced them with Tommy John.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/509300ba1519f94850d443b37e717a71/1d671989375a7803-2e/s540x810/da2ccf4ee8eca51f32275a0d6640e6f55e3b1aed.jpg)\n\n**[Barneys New York:](https://rstyle.me/+zBjIVkKjEIjxBUe9WrTOYw)\n Closing Sale**\n\nAs you may have heard, Barney’s New York is shuttering and the company will soon [only live on as a licensed label at Saks Fifth Avenue](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/09/sunday-review/barneys-saks.html)\n. In the meantime, the company is holding its closing sale. The discounts so far are meager — less than what most other retailers are offering for Black Friday. I haven’t had time to trawl through the inventory, but I recently remembered that Barney’s carries my favorite fragrance: [Helmut Lang’s Curion](https://rstyle.me/+8xsLHirV54sGQFnnYAoz9g)\n. Initially created in 2002, the perfume was short-lived before it was taken off the shelves. But during the time it was on the market, it garnered praise from critics and eventually became sought after by collectors. In 2014, the company relaunched it — and it’s as good as I remember.\n\nCurion is a soft leather scent without any of the smokiness that can make old-world leathers, such as Knize’s, feel fusty and overpowering. It opens with bergamot, mandarin orange, and pink pepper, then almost immediately transitions into suede and carrot seed. In the end, you get a strangely alluring mix of cedar and musk — not an uncommon combination, but so comforting here. I wear mine with leather jackets and cold weather tailoring. It’s a modern leather scent for guys who don’t identify with that version of masculinity that involves big gold chains or piped tobacco. Find a sample of it first, if you can (never blind buy bottles). [Then remember it’s on sale at Barney’s](https://rstyle.me/+8xsLHirV54sGQFnnYAoz9g)\n.\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"10 More Black Friday Sales — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"10 More Black Friday Sales — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Even when it’s online and you can shop from the comfort of your own home, Black Friday still feels like a mad dash to find the best deals.

It adds texture and visual interest, has classic roots but remains modern, and does the good work of keeping you warm. [This one is from Howlin](https://rstyle.me/+6-wclm-RhgpfaFXOYH6Ygw)\n, an Antwerp knitwear brand that relies on Scottish and Irish manufacturers (the company’s name is taken from the Scottish slang for smelly). Howlin’s sweaters are a little slimmer and more contemporary than traditional designs, but they fit reasonably easy. I like them for how well they ride the line between playful and classic. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/69105f7d00a6a05111e74b1ac5ce9aae/497b6ea1c97495b0-bc/s540x810/c2cba3fd91608f75d1112d31e417a56084b6d248.png)\n\n**[JM Weston 180 Loafers ($598)](https://rstyle.me/+iPyKBB5GKLyJHDHelo2m6A)\n**\n\nI love JM Weston’s 180 penny loafers. They’re popular in Japan, but for some reason, less common here in the United States. Not for any good reason, either. They have a rounded toe and high sidewalls, which make them more distinctive than their American and Northampton counterparts. A bit smarter Alden’s loafer; a little less urbane than Edward Green. I find they go just as well with tailored trousers as they do with jeans. The only problem is sizing, [which I covered in this old post](https://dieworkwear.com/post/145918152989/french-pennies-for-summer)\n. I recommend buying them from a place like Mr. Porter, which allows for easy returns if things don’t work out.

But as a purely practical matter, they’re useful when I’m running out of the house and don’t have time to do my hair. Drake’s are really nice if your casualwear leans classic. Theirs are knitted in Scotland from 100% wool, come in [speckled Donegal](https://rstyle.me/+YrzwoqnefheyCwP1yQA1aw)\n and [cable-knit designs](https://rstyle.me/+VrJ3wrocu9PdZOuEqQNP2g)\n, and are sized well.

Whether you favor classic tailored clothing, Japanese workwear, or oversized, minimalist contemporary garb, Mr. Porter likely carries more than a handful of brands for you.\n\nToday, Mr. Porter started their Black Friday promotion, where you can take up to 30% off select items. [Inis Meain’s sweaters are expensive](http://bit.ly/2An9ccz)\n, even with the discount, but absolutely exquisite and a joy to wear. [Engineered Garments](https://rstyle.me/n/db22q9njge)\n, [Blue Blue Japan](http://bit.ly/2AnFpjJ)\n, and [Kapital](http://bit.ly/2AnnkCp)\n are personal favorites for workwear; [SNS Herning](http://bit.ly/2Aoxdjq)\n is great textured knitwear you can layer under heavy coats (be sure to size up). \n\nGiven the scope and size of their inventory, your best bet is to filter by sizing and brands to see what you like. That said, here are ten items that I think are worth highlighting. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/26be52f3dd520321026552b0e8770195/497b6ea1c97495b0-6d/s540x810/d903310c83d005431dbb5ee97d2a24efe179602d.png)\n\n**[Howlin Cream Cable Knit ($210)](https://rstyle.me/+6-wclm-RhgpfaFXOYH6Ygw)\n**\n\nA cream cable knit is one of those genuinely useful items that fits into almost any wardrobe. It adds texture and visual interest, has classic roots but remains modern, and does the good work of keeping you warm. [This one is from Howlin](https://rstyle.me/+6-wclm-RhgpfaFXOYH6Ygw)\n, an Antwerp knitwear brand that relies on Scottish and Irish manufacturers (the company’s name is taken from the Scottish slang for smelly). Howlin’s sweaters are a little slimmer and more contemporary than traditional designs, but they fit reasonably easy. I like them for how well they ride the line between playful and classic. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/69105f7d00a6a05111e74b1ac5ce9aae/497b6ea1c97495b0-bc/s540x810/c2cba3fd91608f75d1112d31e417a56084b6d248.png)\n\n**[JM Weston 180 Loafers ($598)](https://rstyle.me/+iPyKBB5GKLyJHDHelo2m6A)\n**\n\nI love JM Weston’s 180 penny loafers. They’re popular in Japan, but for some reason, less common here in the United States. Not for any good reason, either. They have a rounded toe and high sidewalls, which make them more distinctive than their American and Northampton counterparts. A bit smarter Alden’s loafer; a little less urbane than Edward Green. I find they go just as well with tailored trousers as they do with jeans. The only problem is sizing, [which I covered in this old post](https://dieworkwear.com/post/145918152989/french-pennies-for-summer)\n. I recommend buying them from a place like Mr. Porter, which allows for easy returns if things don’t work out. They have them in [black calf](https://rstyle.me/+_6pPxehKkoQ6G22n8QiYNQ)\n, [burgundy calf](https://rstyle.me/+RnBdvqF6To1lnULF_MTJYw)\n, [tan pebble grain](https://rstyle.me/+ptf8UusgjURhV-ao1m3zEA)\n, and [the very useful dark brown](https://rstyle.me/+iPyKBB5GKLyJHDHelo2m6A)\n.

But as a purely practical matter, they’re useful when I’m running out of the house and don’t have time to do my hair. Drake’s are really nice if your casualwear leans classic. Theirs are knitted in Scotland from 100% wool, come in [speckled Donegal](https://rstyle.me/+YrzwoqnefheyCwP1yQA1aw)\n and [cable-knit designs](https://rstyle.me/+VrJ3wrocu9PdZOuEqQNP2g)\n, and are sized well.

But still, it helps to have some intel.\n\n[Every year at Put This On](https://putthison.com/)\n, I roundup Black Friday sales for our readers. The list, which comes out on Friday, is massive and often reaches into the hundreds of stores. For those who want something more manageable, I also list some of my favorites here. Since some stores have already started their promotions, here are nine early-bird specials that I think are notable. More will come as the week moves on and new deals emerge. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/002dd43356205c768a0bbf15163520f8/a51a20bb6a0029bc-71/s540x810/2c2271862f1f4ce1881ccbb5f7f881150afecb46.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/975727291a0508c6881ad2faa7765c5e/a51a20bb6a0029bc-a7/s540x810/63f28849bd56ae1796f2c5179c77b6049ba7afe8.jpg)\n\n**_[](https://bit.ly/2DkMSjg)\n_**\n\n_**[No Man Walks Alone:](https://bit.ly/2DkMSjg)\n Up to 30% Off On Select Items**_\n\nA few weeks ago, No Man Walks Alone, a sponsor on this site, [released their second lookbook of the season](https://bit.ly/2OI6F1c)\n.

If you purchase a pair, just be sure to size up, as the waist runs quite small. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6a69ddbfd4dadc8909990a8460dc672f/a51a20bb6a0029bc-7e/s540x810/73dcb5f6383ad46848ee4349f7aecbcdd64e4be6.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/516ee3ad46e12225881074edb4d77036/a51a20bb6a0029bc-b6/s540x810/cc06ebd5297b0d488af4329dd9da660abef2297f.jpg)\n\n**_[](https://rstyle.me/+K6Rud1ClQLaX99THrcYLNA)\n_**\n\n**_[J. Crew:](https://rstyle.me/+K6Rud1ClQLaX99THrcYLNA)\n 50% Off Full-Priced Items and an Extra 60% Off Sale, Code SHOPFIRST_  \n**\n\nI was at J. Crew recently, exchanging something I bought online. After finishing at the counter, I took some time to browse around the store. A lot has been written about the company’s decline – the loss of direction and supposed drop in quality. But while browsing around, I was pleasantly surprised. Much of what people loved about J. Crew ten years ago still seems present. The clothes are exceedingly wearable. They allow you to blend into almost any office, but still look better than average. For guys who want to build a wardrobe on a budget, J. Crew is an exceptional value. \n\nFor example, [this Wallace & Barnes flannel shirt](https://rstyle.me/+uDFEZOWYM1uqTLNQYWa5zw)\n ($49 on sale) is made from an 8.2 oz brushed cotton, has a chambray-lined yoke, and features triple-needle seams for both durability and vintage effect (old workwear shirts used to be made this way). They have two fits in their [Japanese raw selvedge denim jeans](https://rstyle.me/+4wrrbo_jxvpGHvMqPEBIig)\n ($74 per pair). [I also love their chamois shirts](https://rstyle.me/+jBYmNaiAhdCbAivbFGWu5Q)\n ($49), even if they’re confusingly sized. Just go with your standard size in their classic fit — it’s slim enough.\n\nAdditionally, [their field mechanic jacket](https://rstyle.me/+S5oycKBS0Si8tv2alHI2gQ)\n continues to be one of the best values in outerwear. The jacket is just so smartly designed. It has a cinched waist to give the jacket some shape, ample pocket space, and a stowaway hood for when it rains. The stand-up collar frames the face well, and the easy-to-maintain, wash-and-wearability means you don’t have to baby this very much. This is the sort of thing you can wear with jeans, chunky sweaters, and oxford button-downs. J. Crew has offered it every season for as long as I can remember, and I’m glad you can still find it in the store. At $100 with the promotion, you could hardly do better. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f223bc6547cb3a5b84e6d035390926c/a51a20bb6a0029bc-1f/s540x810/1c84c7cb42a49cff231239427f069555ccccc8cf.jpg)\n\n**_[](http://tidd.ly/29eeb983)\n_**\n\n_**[End](http://tidd.ly/29eeb983)\n: 20% Off Sitewide, Code EARLY**_\n\nThe thing to remember about End is that they’re located in the UK, which means that listed prices tend to be about ~20% lower than what you’ll find at most other shops (since they automatically deduct for VAT). Add to that their current 20% off promotion and things become pretty sweet. \n\nSome of my favorite brands here include [Nigel Cabourn](http://tidd.ly/5cc6eca6)\n, [Engineered Garments](http://tidd.ly/bafc3180)\n, [Blue Blue Japan](http://tidd.ly/6848f375)\n, [Battenwear](http://tidd.ly/541ac097)\n, [Margaret Howell](http://tidd.ly/e6868311)\n, [Ten C](http://tidd.ly/7726a04c)\n, and [Levi’s Vintage Clothing](http://tidd.ly/bd3567fa)\n. [Margiela’s German Army Trainers](http://tidd.ly/a2ac453e)\n are also on sale, along with a ton of other shoes from [Common Projects](http://tidd.ly/37aac8c3)\n, [Buttero](http://tidd.ly/9b633c0e)\n, [Astorflex](http://tidd.ly/121ac04f)\n, and [Danner](http://tidd.ly/c9918e58)\n. For chunky, textured knitwear you can layer under casual coats, check out [Howlin by Morrison](http://tidd.ly/5e3ee478)\n, [Jaimeson’s](http://tidd.ly/6cfb61a3)\n, and [SNS Herning](http://tidd.ly/d674c429)\n. I also like the bags from [And Wander](http://tidd.ly/8beb3c61)\n and [Master Piece](http://tidd.ly/839a7c7)\n.\n\nAdditionally, End is one of the best places to [buy a Barbour jacket](http://tidd.ly/cf9aafe8)\n. With the promotion, [the Bedale](http://tidd.ly/12936ba9)\n comes down to $320 and [the Beaufort is $332](http://tidd.ly/d7d8e0c0)\n. End also collaborated with Barbour this season on a [special patchwork version of the Ashby](http://tidd.ly/83f8d115)\n, which is a slimmer version of the Bedale. The design echos a theme seen in other Barbour collaborations, notably the ones with [Rowing Blazers](https://rowingblazers.com/collections/barbour)\n and [Alexa Chung](https://rstyle.me/+22iCq6p5aQcMJQzaT-fz4w)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6474c6d5ffd8110e68d14dbbd9e4edba/a51a20bb6a0029bc-49/s540x810/24e5acd2ba0f18df746c2e4fa0e0b52addd48142.jpg)\n\n_**[Brooks Brothers:](https://rstyle.me/+6JgU3jUg7HhAQ2YFeRD8WQ)\n Discounts Sitewide, Including OCBDs**_\n\nAlmost everything at Brooks Brother is on sale right now, including their famous oxford-cloth button-downs in [solid colors](https://rstyle.me/+oOC9Hc4k_es0Rm0RiJaxdw)\n and [various](https://rstyle.me/+dFIxmECr-eA86np4byw3Zw)\n [types of](https://rstyle.me/+P_5fYTfp4nIKuExgoAjQvQ)\n [stripes](https://rstyle.me/+rQXDoTKwmyZnqT3RAFJZMQ)\n. Since the company upgraded to its unlined collar a few years ago, their button-down price jumped from about $90 to $140. With the current promotion, however, the price comes down to $98 — roughly to what it was in yesteryears. I find light-blue oxford button-downs can be worn with anything described as Ivy, Americana, or even workwear (e.g., suits and sport coats, field jackets, or brands like [Engineered Garments](https://rstyle.me/+6ZBJnp48DOTZ75gZC9UkgQ)\n). I hesitate to call anything a wardrobe essential, but for me, an OCBD is as close to essential as anything comes.\n\nBrooks Brothers also put their two most iconic loafers on sale: their tassel loafer — which comes in [calfskin](https://rstyle.me/+HlQoYKyuY3VTfq03L9W6qQ)\n, [shell cordovan](https://rstyle.me/+NBMIVkptczIv9X69qw2Y6Q)\n, and [brown suede](https://rstyle.me/+nfkm9VWMYiq9FVxh_DJ6Eg)\n – and their [unlined shell cordovan penny loafers](https://rstyle.me/+H1dOT6hn4qcvbGlYuBP6ig)\n (both styles made in the USA by Alden). Those shell cordovan pennies are among my favorite shoes. Not only can they be worn with your usual sport coats and flannels, but they can also work in surprisingly contemporary contexts. [Kyle at No Man Walks Alone](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bve-7hNgVpz/)\n pairs them with jeans, t-shirts, and slim corduroy sport coats. I sometimes wear mine with fatigues and chunky Arans. Note, Alden confirmed with me a few months ago that they’ve discontinued their relationship with Brooks Brothers, so once these are gone, they’re gone. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0dae1e2e7d0690cda3c6303c9de30ef0/a51a20bb6a0029bc-10/s540x810/8ff918e02c6fe194233352a438e771549d6cdb61.jpg)\n\n**[](http://bit.ly/2AmCR5n)\n**\n\n_**[East Dane:](http://bit.ly/2AmCR5n)\n Up to 30% Off, Code MORE19 Stackable**_\n\nFor whatever reason, East Dane often has one of the more overlooked sale sections every season.

[At the top of the list is this Kaptain Sunshine coat](https://www.namu-shop.com/collections/man/products/kaptain-sunshine-traveller-coat-navy?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=24830-90e638)\n, which I rave about constantly because I rely on it so often (mine is navy as well). It’s made from a hefty Melton wool, which is a bit thick, substantial, and allows the coat to take on its own shape when worn. The coat has an A-frame silhouette, hidden equestrian straps, and a smartly designed collar that looks great when popped from the back. The coat runs a bit roomy, so the size 36 could fit someone up to a 38, I think.\n\nI also love a lot of the outerwear this season from Eastlogue, a South Korean company doing their takes on vintage Americana, workwear, and outdoor clothing. Like a lot of offbeat workwear, these clothes draw enough from classic clothing to feel like they’ll be wearable in five years. At the same time, they’re directional enough to also be interesting. [The Traveler jacket](https://www.namu-shop.com/collections/man/products/eastlogue-traveler-jacket-beige-olive?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=24830-90e638)\n is the company’s take on fleece liners, which I think looks particularly good with fatigues. [There are also two](https://www.namu-shop.com/collections/man/products/eastlogue-utility-shield-parka-olive?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=24830-90e638)\n [down-filled coats](https://www.namu-shop.com/collections/man/products/eastlogue-c-1-down-parka-red-quantum?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=24830-90e638)\n with an interesting configuration of pockets.

Dozens of things have come and gone from that era — many first described as classic, but couldn’t last past the prep craze. But LL Bean’s duck boots have a kind of versatility that’s hard to beat. They go with jeans and cords, Barbour jackets and French chore coats, tweeds and casual overcoats. They work with almost any wardrobe that can be considered vaguely classic.\n\nThey’re also some of the best foul-weather boots you’ll find anywhere. Originally called Maine hunting shoes, they were designed for outdoorsman tramping around the countryside. They have a fully waterproof rubber construction, which wraps around the top of your foot, while the shaft is made from leather. And they have that better-with-age quality I love. I leave mine out on my back porch during the summer cause I think the leather looks better when it’s sunfaded.\n\nLL Bean boots run about $150 shipped, but for today only, the company is having a 25% off sale (just use the checkout code FLASH25). That puts these at about $100 to $110, depending on the model. And while the company’s return policy isn’t as good as it once was, they still guarantee product satisfaction for up to one year. Go a full-size down in the unlined version (or 1.5 sizes down if you wear half sizes), but take your regular size for lined models.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/917f9a3b8cf3672ca1fd1832ac204059/a51a20bb6a0029bc-06/s540x810/7d6e736836b461bd4c1ac9c1a25ae65ec7d1f18b.jpg)\n\n**_[American Trench:](https://www.americantrench.com/collections/socks/products/boot-socks-in-wool-and-silk?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=16618-4d9a9b)\n 20% Off Everything, Code BFCM2019_**\n\nA couple of years ago, I took a chance on these [wool-silk boot socks from American Trench](https://www.americantrench.com/collections/socks/products/boot-socks-in-wool-and-silk?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=16618-4d9a9b)\n. They’re $30 a pair (or $24 with the current promotion), which admittedly is a lot to pay for casual socks. But I’ve been surprised by how much I like them. They’re cozy, durable, and come in handsome colors. The flecks of color add visual interest without being obnoxious. They’re also knitted at a family-owned, North Carolina mill using Italian yarn. I rely on them almost exclusively when I’m wearing something casual this half of the year. [American Trench’s Kennedy socks,](https://www.americantrench.com/collections/kennedy/products/fw19-kennedy-luxe-athletic-socks-classic-colors?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=16618-4d9a9b)\n which are inspired by something President Kennedy once wore, are also popular.

That said, I use Kiehl’s [24-Hour Oil Eliminator Moisturizer](http://bit.ly/2hZ5r2P)\n in the summer, then their [Ultra Facial Cream](http://bit.ly/2iwbEjG)\n in the winter. They’re both facial moisturizers, but the first is good when your skin is more likely to be oily, while the second is best when the weather is cold and dry. If you use the [Midnight Recovery Concentrate Oil](http://bit.ly/2iwl2Ef)\n after coming out of the shower, you may not even need to use a moisturizer the next day. [Their body scrub soaps](https://rstyle.me/~aI9IN)\n are a little more expensive than your average bar of soap, but they last much longer and slough off dead skin. [I also like their shampoos](http://bit.ly/2An9FeL)\n, which are formulated for different hair types. I find their [Oil Infused Shampoo](http://bit.ly/2iwc9ua)\n to be great for dry hair. \n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7cef74a47e2e88555328e0f5099436c4/a51a20bb6a0029bc-22/s540x810/c771986e1ca7181ad67746a03432222df71b9b1d.jpg)\n\nI remember when Black Friday was about waking up early to try to beat the crowds, only to wind up standing in line and wondering whether the savings are worth the trouble.

The list, which comes out on Friday, is massive and often reaches into the hundreds of stores. For those who want something more manageable, I also list some of my favorites here.

I also like the bags from [And Wander](http://tidd.ly/8beb3c61)\n and [Master Piece](http://tidd.ly/839a7c7)\n.\n\nAdditionally, End is one of the best places to [buy a Barbour jacket](http://tidd.ly/cf9aafe8)\n. With the promotion, [the Bedale](http://tidd.ly/12936ba9)\n comes down to $320 and [the Beaufort is $332](http://tidd.ly/d7d8e0c0)\n. End also collaborated with Barbour this season on a [special patchwork version of the Ashby](http://tidd.ly/83f8d115)\n, which is a slimmer version of the Bedale. The design echos a theme seen in other Barbour collaborations, notably the ones with [Rowing Blazers](https://rowingblazers.com/collections/barbour)\n and [Alexa Chung](https://rstyle.me/+22iCq6p5aQcMJQzaT-fz4w)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6474c6d5ffd8110e68d14dbbd9e4edba/a51a20bb6a0029bc-49/s540x810/24e5acd2ba0f18df746c2e4fa0e0b52addd48142.jpg)\n\n_**[Brooks Brothers:](https://rstyle.me/+6JgU3jUg7HhAQ2YFeRD8WQ)\n Discounts Sitewide, Including OCBDs**_\n\nAlmost everything at Brooks Brother is on sale right now, including their famous oxford-cloth button-downs in [solid colors](https://rstyle.me/+oOC9Hc4k_es0Rm0RiJaxdw)\n and [various](https://rstyle.me/+dFIxmECr-eA86np4byw3Zw)\n [types of](https://rstyle.me/+P_5fYTfp4nIKuExgoAjQvQ)\n [stripes](https://rstyle.me/+rQXDoTKwmyZnqT3RAFJZMQ)\n. Since the company upgraded to its unlined collar a few years ago, their button-down price jumped from about $90 to $140. With the current promotion, however, the price comes down to $98 — roughly to what it was in yesteryears. I find light-blue oxford button-downs can be worn with anything described as Ivy, Americana, or even workwear (e.g., suits and sport coats, field jackets, or brands like [Engineered Garments](https://rstyle.me/+6ZBJnp48DOTZ75gZC9UkgQ)\n). I hesitate to call anything a wardrobe essential, but for me, an OCBD is as close to essential as anything comes.\n\nBrooks Brothers also put their two most iconic loafers on sale: their tassel loafer — which comes in [calfskin](https://rstyle.me/+HlQoYKyuY3VTfq03L9W6qQ)\n, [shell cordovan](https://rstyle.me/+NBMIVkptczIv9X69qw2Y6Q)\n, and [brown suede](https://rstyle.me/+nfkm9VWMYiq9FVxh_DJ6Eg)\n – and their [unlined shell cordovan penny loafers](https://rstyle.me/+H1dOT6hn4qcvbGlYuBP6ig)\n (both styles made in the USA by Alden). Those shell cordovan pennies are among my favorite shoes. Not only can they be worn with your usual sport coats and flannels, but they can also work in surprisingly contemporary contexts. [Kyle at No Man Walks Alone](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bve-7hNgVpz/)\n pairs them with jeans, t-shirts, and slim corduroy sport coats. I sometimes wear mine with fatigues and chunky Arans. Note, Alden confirmed with me a few months ago that they’ve discontinued their relationship with Brooks Brothers, so once these are gone, they’re gone. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0dae1e2e7d0690cda3c6303c9de30ef0/a51a20bb6a0029bc-10/s540x810/8ff918e02c6fe194233352a438e771549d6cdb61.jpg)\n\n**[](http://bit.ly/2AmCR5n)\n**\n\n_**[East Dane:](http://bit.ly/2AmCR5n)\n Up to 30% Off, Code MORE19 Stackable**_\n\nFor whatever reason, East Dane often has one of the more overlooked sale sections every season.

[At the top of the list is this Kaptain Sunshine coat](https://www.namu-shop.com/collections/man/products/kaptain-sunshine-traveller-coat-navy?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=24830-90e638)\n, which I rave about constantly because I rely on it so often (mine is navy as well). It’s made from a hefty Melton wool, which is a bit thick, substantial, and allows the coat to take on its own shape when worn. The coat has an A-frame silhouette, hidden equestrian straps, and a smartly designed collar that looks great when popped from the back. The coat runs a bit roomy, so the size 36 could fit someone up to a 38, I think.\n\nI also love a lot of the outerwear this season from Eastlogue, a South Korean company doing their takes on vintage Americana, workwear, and outdoor clothing. Like a lot of offbeat workwear, these clothes draw enough from classic clothing to feel like they’ll be wearable in five years. At the same time, they’re directional enough to also be interesting. [The Traveler jacket](https://www.namu-shop.com/collections/man/products/eastlogue-traveler-jacket-beige-olive?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=24830-90e638)\n is the company’s take on fleece liners, which I think looks particularly good with fatigues. [There are also two](https://www.namu-shop.com/collections/man/products/eastlogue-utility-shield-parka-olive?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=24830-90e638)\n [down-filled coats](https://www.namu-shop.com/collections/man/products/eastlogue-c-1-down-parka-red-quantum?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=24830-90e638)\n with an interesting configuration of pockets.

Dozens of things have come and gone from that era — many first described as classic, but couldn’t last past the prep craze. But LL Bean’s duck boots have a kind of versatility that’s hard to beat. They go with jeans and cords, Barbour jackets and French chore coats, tweeds and casual overcoats. They work with almost any wardrobe that can be considered vaguely classic.\n\nThey’re also some of the best foul-weather boots you’ll find anywhere. Originally called Maine hunting shoes, they were designed for outdoorsman tramping around the countryside. They have a fully waterproof rubber construction, which wraps around the top of your foot, while the shaft is made from leather. And they have that better-with-age quality I love. I leave mine out on my back porch during the summer cause I think the leather looks better when it’s sunfaded.\n\nLL Bean boots run about $150 shipped, but for today only, the company is having a 25% off sale (just use the checkout code FLASH25). That puts these at about $100 to $110, depending on the model. And while the company’s return policy isn’t as good as it once was, they still guarantee product satisfaction for up to one year. Go a full-size down in the unlined version (or 1.5 sizes down if you wear half sizes), but take your regular size for lined models.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/917f9a3b8cf3672ca1fd1832ac204059/a51a20bb6a0029bc-06/s540x810/7d6e736836b461bd4c1ac9c1a25ae65ec7d1f18b.jpg)\n\n**_[American Trench:](https://www.americantrench.com/collections/socks/products/boot-socks-in-wool-and-silk?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=16618-4d9a9b)\n 20% Off Everything, Code BFCM2019_**\n\nA couple of years ago, I took a chance on these [wool-silk boot socks from American Trench](https://www.americantrench.com/collections/socks/products/boot-socks-in-wool-and-silk?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=16618-4d9a9b)\n. They’re $30 a pair (or $24 with the current promotion), which admittedly is a lot to pay for casual socks. But I’ve been surprised by how much I like them. They’re cozy, durable, and come in handsome colors. The flecks of color add visual interest without being obnoxious. They’re also knitted at a family-owned, North Carolina mill using Italian yarn. I rely on them almost exclusively when I’m wearing something casual this half of the year. [American Trench’s Kennedy socks,](https://www.americantrench.com/collections/kennedy/products/fw19-kennedy-luxe-athletic-socks-classic-colors?tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=16618-4d9a9b)\n which are inspired by something President Kennedy once wore, are also popular.

That said, I use Kiehl’s [24-Hour Oil Eliminator Moisturizer](http://bit.ly/2hZ5r2P)\n in the summer, then their [Ultra Facial Cream](http://bit.ly/2iwbEjG)\n in the winter. They’re both facial moisturizers, but the first is good when your skin is more likely to be oily, while the second is best when the weather is cold and dry. If you use the [Midnight Recovery Concentrate Oil](http://bit.ly/2iwl2Ef)\n after coming out of the shower, you may not even need to use a moisturizer the next day. [Their body scrub soaps](https://rstyle.me/~aI9IN)\n are a little more expensive than your average bar of soap, but they last much longer and slough off dead skin. [I also like their shampoos](http://bit.ly/2An9FeL)\n, which are formulated for different hair types. I find their [Oil Infused Shampoo](http://bit.ly/2iwc9ua)\n to be great for dry hair. \n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Nine Stellar Black Friday Sales — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Nine Stellar Black Friday Sales — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"I remember when Black Friday was about waking up early to try to beat the crowds, only to wind up standing in line and wondering whether the savings are worth the trouble.

I remember being excited about it because Greg has a uniquely open-minded view on men’s style. Even today, most shops are singularly focused on prep, workwear, or the _avant-garde_ – they push a very specific look. No Man Walks Alone mixes all three in a way that feels natural. \n\n[In a recent interview at Handcut Radio](https://www.handcutradio.com/episodes/24/9/2019/greg-lellouche-on-why-no-man-walks-alone-019)\n, Greg says he thinks streetwear has had a positive influence on menswear, at least on balance. “I like how streetwear has liberated men from the idea of a uniform. They can wear crazy printed pants with an old sweatshirt from high school and not feel ridiculous about mix-and-matching different perspectives. By broadening the scope, it’ll eventually trickle down to a mainstream way of dressing, and it’ll bring a bit more freedom and individuality to men’s style.” That open-mindedness probably explains why you can find everything from Italian tailoring to Japanese workwear to the avant-garde at his shop.\n\nTo celebrate their sixth anniversary, No Man Walks Alone is offering a 20% discount if you use the checkout code sixyears. The promotion is running until this Tuesday, October 22nd. Here are nine things in the store I’ve been admiring.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c401b6478239a8845704da81778917e8/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-b0/s540x810/f2962305d4f50f62718ffc36563023c7dff0be58.jpg)\n\n**[No Man Walks Alone x Sartoria Carrara](https://bit.ly/2nTAMsF)\n**\n\n[No Man Walks Alone’s new in-house tailoring line](https://bit.ly/2nTAMsF)\n is made in Italy by Sartoria Carrara, a small factory that has been producing private-label tailoring for about twenty years for various high-end brands. A few years ago, [Patrick Johnson](https://row.pjt.com/)\n took a 50% interest in the business and has been using it for their higher-end range. No Man Walks Alone’s coats are fully canvassed but feature a little less handwork than their [Sartoria Formosa tailoring](https://bit.ly/2W0Bqkw)\n (which is entirely benchmade). Instead, these are mostly machine sewn with handwork only where it counts most (e.g., hand-cut pattern; handsewn armhole, gorge, and collar; and handsewn lapel buttonhole).\n\n“We went through four rounds of prototyping to adjust the block, so it suits what I consider a US standard fit,” Greg tells me. “We tried to not mess with their styling too much, except for killing the lapel belly that they tend to put on their jackets. I wanted to keep their house style, as I like that it’s not a caricatural Neapolitan look. The gorge is a little lower, the lapel is not out of proportions, and the length is right.”\n\nFriends of mine who have seen the line in-person say it’s impressive, especially for the price. Sport coats are about $1,400 and suits are just $300 more. I’ve only seen the line online, but I like the styling. The coats have that distinctive Italian look that gives them some verve, but they don’t veer into the hashtag menswear style that has come to dominate Instagram. For guys who are looking for a successor to Eidos, this could be it. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09e3691ab77358ee6329f3670b802752/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-7e/s540x810/5f7bac5ab03ab32fe3add413cc5e78e3fe3d82f5.jpg)\n\n**[Camoshita Robe Coat](https://bit.ly/2MQxE9Z)\n**\n\n[Camoshita’s robe coat](https://bit.ly/2MQxE9Z)\n is loosely based on the wait coat, a predecessor to the polo coat initially worn between polo period matches. Original wait coats featured patched pockets, a wraparound construction, and a belted closure. This robe coat is somewhat similar, but the fit is much more modern. \n\nDoes it look like a bathrobe? Yes, kind of. Is it awesome? Absolutely. I often wear a Document robe coat in the fall, when the temperatures are cold but not frigid, with slim jeans and textured sweaters. It’s also good with wide-legged trousers for a contemporary look. Pair the outfit with side zip boots, Stan Smiths, or minimalist sneakers. Camoshita’s version features peak lapels, rather than Document’s shawl collar.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/77a3e822a2dc0873dda9bfca4e21504a/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-cf/s540x810/4b86f859a5b7161f2890ec7100567745dfb3b9e7.jpg)\n\n**[Doppiaa Five-Pocket Trousers](https://bit.ly/2BjDMSE)\n**\n\nI’ve been really into five-pocket trousers lately as an alternative to jeans. They’re a little dressier than denim but more causal than tailored trousers, which makes them perfect for those in-between occasions (e.g., holiday parties and weekend evenings). [Doppiaa’s are made in an ideal shade of brown](https://bit.ly/2BjDMSE)\n. They have a grey cast that allows them to pair well with cooler colors such as navy and gray, which are likely staples in your wardrobe. Plus, this color, known as taupe, will make you look like a furry mole. Who doesn’t want to look like a furry mole?\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fbd47720983d7ff8ea936599376e4ac9/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-90/s540x810/a0b2f8317bbab3383970ab0d5df74f7c1ab05be9.jpg)\n\n**[Monitaly Fair Isle Sweater](https://bit.ly/2nptMU7)\n**\n\nI love Yuki Matsuda’s approach to design. It’s offbeat and full of humor; it doesn’t take itself too seriously. Yet, it also relies on many of the Americana and workwear basics that many men will find familiar (and thus, be easy to wear). His sub-labels — Monitaly, Yuketen, Chamula, and Epperson Mountaineering included — are inspired by archival designs and vintage clothing without being overly literal. They also occasionally feature a bit of handwork. [This Fair Isle sweater](https://bit.ly/2nptMU7)\n, for example, is hand-knitted by Native craftspeople in Mexico. It’s made from a plush, handspun merino yarn, which makes it softer than the Fair Isle Shetlands you may find in the UK. You can layer it under anything to add a bit of texture and pattern. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b607647425e7b592c43fa54b8cbcffc4/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-58/s540x810/6ff607c855d33108b3f0c1783f017664440c88ba.jpg)\n\n**[Talarico Umbrella](https://bit.ly/2VNMPoe)\n**\n\nMost umbrellas today are produced inside of factories and, often, in lower-cost countries such as China. Mario Talarico works with his nephew, who is also named Mario Talarico, in the Spanish Quarters of Naples. Their umbrellas are made from a single piece of wood that has been steam bent to form a J-shaped handle. The umbrellas are sturdy and reliable, but you’re mostly purchasing for the craft. Few umbrellas today are handmade like this. Of those produced, Talarico’s are the only ones made in a tiny, two-man workshop. If I didn’t have a few already, [I would pick up this one in a handsome plaid](https://bit.ly/2VNMPoe)\n.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/14cf65dad916f720f112101e2d97d0aa/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-8b/s540x810/a119e17a8da30e97cdfb1c6060b79a7f0b16e6fc.jpg)\n\n**[Sage de Cret Melton Coat](https://bit.ly/2lJQkP1)\n**\n\nSome of Sage de Cret’s clothes can look a bit ordinary at times, even when you see them hanging on a rack in a store. But when you try them on, they feel so right — the silhouettes are well done, the details are stylish, and the fabrics are comfortable. I came across the line a few seasons ago at [Reliquary](https://reliquarysf.com/)\n, a local San Francisco shop, and walked away very impressed. [This Melton wool overcoat](https://bit.ly/2lJQkP1)\n features an A-line silhouette and a collar that looks good when popped from the back. It’s a simple piece, but the kind of thing you can throw on in the morning over a chunky knit and some jeans. Unlike lightweight overcoats, the material is hefty enough to lend its own shape. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/501f0d3930df013987638ec272d88a6d/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-dc/s540x810/a3104ff896a8fa1afa62c7ade4c4b8e78de7c1ad.jpg)\n\n**[Scott & Charters Shawl Collar Cardigan](https://bit.ly/31nHi96)\n**\n\nScott & Charter’s cardigans aren’t inexpensive, but they’re a considerable step up from more affordable models. Cheaper cardigans are typically made with less wool, which means the shawl collar can be a little skimpy and flat. Scott & Charters’ version is a chunky, multi-ply lambswool knit with a collar that hangs like a thick roll of dough. I mostly wear mine around the house with jeans and a flannel shirt, but they’re also suitable for hanging out in the neighborhood.

I remember being excited about it because Greg has a uniquely open-minded view on men’s style. Even today, most shops are singularly focused on prep, workwear, or the _avant-garde_ – they push a very specific look. No Man Walks Alone mixes all three in a way that feels natural. \n\n[In a recent interview at Handcut Radio](https://www.handcutradio.com/episodes/24/9/2019/greg-lellouche-on-why-no-man-walks-alone-019)\n, Greg says he thinks streetwear has had a positive influence on menswear, at least on balance. “I like how streetwear has liberated men from the idea of a uniform. They can wear crazy printed pants with an old sweatshirt from high school and not feel ridiculous about mix-and-matching different perspectives. By broadening the scope, it’ll eventually trickle down to a mainstream way of dressing, and it’ll bring a bit more freedom and individuality to men’s style.” That open-mindedness probably explains why you can find everything from Italian tailoring to Japanese workwear to the avant-garde at his shop.\n\nTo celebrate their sixth anniversary, No Man Walks Alone is offering a 20% discount if you use the checkout code sixyears. The promotion is running until this Tuesday, October 22nd. Here are nine things in the store I’ve been admiring.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c401b6478239a8845704da81778917e8/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-b0/s540x810/f2962305d4f50f62718ffc36563023c7dff0be58.jpg)\n\n**[No Man Walks Alone x Sartoria Carrara](https://bit.ly/2nTAMsF)\n**\n\n[No Man Walks Alone’s new in-house tailoring line](https://bit.ly/2nTAMsF)\n is made in Italy by Sartoria Carrara, a small factory that has been producing private-label tailoring for about twenty years for various high-end brands. A few years ago, [Patrick Johnson](https://row.pjt.com/)\n took a 50% interest in the business and has been using it for their higher-end range. No Man Walks Alone’s coats are fully canvassed but feature a little less handwork than their [Sartoria Formosa tailoring](https://bit.ly/2W0Bqkw)\n (which is entirely benchmade). Instead, these are mostly machine sewn with handwork only where it counts most (e.g., hand-cut pattern; handsewn armhole, gorge, and collar; and handsewn lapel buttonhole).\n\n“We went through four rounds of prototyping to adjust the block, so it suits what I consider a US standard fit,” Greg tells me. “We tried to not mess with their styling too much, except for killing the lapel belly that they tend to put on their jackets. I wanted to keep their house style, as I like that it’s not a caricatural Neapolitan look. The gorge is a little lower, the lapel is not out of proportions, and the length is right.”\n\nFriends of mine who have seen the line in-person say it’s impressive, especially for the price. Sport coats are about $1,400 and suits are just $300 more. I’ve only seen the line online, but I like the styling. The coats have that distinctive Italian look that gives them some verve, but they don’t veer into the hashtag menswear style that has come to dominate Instagram. For guys who are looking for a successor to Eidos, this could be it. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09e3691ab77358ee6329f3670b802752/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-7e/s540x810/5f7bac5ab03ab32fe3add413cc5e78e3fe3d82f5.jpg)\n\n**[Camoshita Robe Coat](https://bit.ly/2MQxE9Z)\n**\n\n[Camoshita’s robe coat](https://bit.ly/2MQxE9Z)\n is loosely based on the wait coat, a predecessor to the polo coat initially worn between polo period matches. Original wait coats featured patched pockets, a wraparound construction, and a belted closure. This robe coat is somewhat similar, but the fit is much more modern. \n\nDoes it look like a bathrobe? Yes, kind of. Is it awesome? Absolutely. I often wear a Document robe coat in the fall, when the temperatures are cold but not frigid, with slim jeans and textured sweaters. It’s also good with wide-legged trousers for a contemporary look. Pair the outfit with side zip boots, Stan Smiths, or minimalist sneakers. Camoshita’s version features peak lapels, rather than Document’s shawl collar.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/77a3e822a2dc0873dda9bfca4e21504a/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-cf/s540x810/4b86f859a5b7161f2890ec7100567745dfb3b9e7.jpg)\n\n**[Doppiaa Five-Pocket Trousers](https://bit.ly/2BjDMSE)\n**\n\nI’ve been really into five-pocket trousers lately as an alternative to jeans. They’re a little dressier than denim but more causal than tailored trousers, which makes them perfect for those in-between occasions (e.g., holiday parties and weekend evenings). [Doppiaa’s are made in an ideal shade of brown](https://bit.ly/2BjDMSE)\n. They have a grey cast that allows them to pair well with cooler colors such as navy and gray, which are likely staples in your wardrobe. Plus, this color, known as taupe, will make you look like a furry mole. Who doesn’t want to look like a furry mole?\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fbd47720983d7ff8ea936599376e4ac9/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-90/s540x810/a0b2f8317bbab3383970ab0d5df74f7c1ab05be9.jpg)\n\n**[Monitaly Fair Isle Sweater](https://bit.ly/2nptMU7)\n**\n\nI love Yuki Matsuda’s approach to design. It’s offbeat and full of humor; it doesn’t take itself too seriously. Yet, it also relies on many of the Americana and workwear basics that many men will find familiar (and thus, be easy to wear). His sub-labels — Monitaly, Yuketen, Chamula, and Epperson Mountaineering included — are inspired by archival designs and vintage clothing without being overly literal. They also occasionally feature a bit of handwork. [This Fair Isle sweater](https://bit.ly/2nptMU7)\n, for example, is hand-knitted by Native craftspeople in Mexico. It’s made from a plush, handspun merino yarn, which makes it softer than the Fair Isle Shetlands you may find in the UK. You can layer it under anything to add a bit of texture and pattern. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b607647425e7b592c43fa54b8cbcffc4/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-58/s540x810/6ff607c855d33108b3f0c1783f017664440c88ba.jpg)\n\n**[Talarico Umbrella](https://bit.ly/2VNMPoe)\n**\n\nMost umbrellas today are produced inside of factories and, often, in lower-cost countries such as China. Mario Talarico works with his nephew, who is also named Mario Talarico, in the Spanish Quarters of Naples. Their umbrellas are made from a single piece of wood that has been steam bent to form a J-shaped handle. The umbrellas are sturdy and reliable, but you’re mostly purchasing for the craft. Few umbrellas today are handmade like this. Of those produced, Talarico’s are the only ones made in a tiny, two-man workshop. If I didn’t have a few already, [I would pick up this one in a handsome plaid](https://bit.ly/2VNMPoe)\n.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/14cf65dad916f720f112101e2d97d0aa/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-8b/s540x810/a119e17a8da30e97cdfb1c6060b79a7f0b16e6fc.jpg)\n\n**[Sage de Cret Melton Coat](https://bit.ly/2lJQkP1)\n**\n\nSome of Sage de Cret’s clothes can look a bit ordinary at times, even when you see them hanging on a rack in a store. But when you try them on, they feel so right — the silhouettes are well done, the details are stylish, and the fabrics are comfortable. I came across the line a few seasons ago at [Reliquary](https://reliquarysf.com/)\n, a local San Francisco shop, and walked away very impressed. [This Melton wool overcoat](https://bit.ly/2lJQkP1)\n features an A-line silhouette and a collar that looks good when popped from the back. It’s a simple piece, but the kind of thing you can throw on in the morning over a chunky knit and some jeans. Unlike lightweight overcoats, the material is hefty enough to lend its own shape. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/501f0d3930df013987638ec272d88a6d/8fe9bca89ca9fb0f-dc/s540x810/a3104ff896a8fa1afa62c7ade4c4b8e78de7c1ad.jpg)\n\n**[Scott & Charters Shawl Collar Cardigan](https://bit.ly/31nHi96)\n**\n\nScott & Charter’s cardigans aren’t inexpensive, but they’re a considerable step up from more affordable models. Cheaper cardigans are typically made with less wool, which means the shawl collar can be a little skimpy and flat. Scott & Charters’ version is a chunky, multi-ply lambswool knit with a collar that hangs like a thick roll of dough. I mostly wear mine around the house with jeans and a flannel shirt, but they’re also suitable for hanging out in the neighborhood. And during the holidays, they’re an excellent substitute for a tailored jacket when you’re entertaining guests. They’re slouchy, cozy, and unpretentious.

So long as I could comfortably close the waist and the pants didn’t fall down, they fit. Then I learned about Floppy Butt, also known as the “silent killer of silhouettes.” Hidden behind people, unseen without special mirrors, Floppy Butt all too often goes undetected. Truth be told, I still suffer from Floppy Butt — my butt, indeed, is very floppy. But the condition no longer shows up in my pants, which is the important thing. \n\nFloppy Butt is a technical term, not a colloquial one, for when you have horseshoe-shaped folds underneath your seat (a polite person’s way of saying butt, which is rude). The condition is often accompanied by ripples down the back of the legs and fullness around the seat (again, butt, or in the Queen’s English, arse). It can be difficult to spot this at home with a regular mirror. When you crane your back to see how you look from behind, you’ve already distorted your silhouette. Better if you can find a three-way mirror, say when you’re walking through a department store. Or, if you have friends and family members, ask them to inspect your posterior (i.e., seat, butt, and arse).\n\nIt brings me no joy to say this, but you probably suffer from Floppy Butt without even knowing it. Much like how a suit jacket hangs from the shoulders, trousers hang from the waistband — and the rise determines where the waistband rests. Swing this delicate balance scale in one direction or the other, and suddenly, things can get distorted. You may have Floppy Butt because your trousers are too large for your pancaked-shaped seat (no judgement, as my seat is inverted like crescent-shaped Florentine lapels). Or, like most men, you stand with your hips forward and knees locked (a posture my friend David describes as Auditioning Male Pornstar).\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82df52835128d1c0282f335cd931f5b5/593eebd830229976-fe/s540x810/0c5ca26d929ef559d07b10edba1d24832e8b750c.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ae3931d5d0d70800c7c826ae3c121ac/593eebd830229976-91/s540x810/bd2765a4c4de2db8abcddc3625939dac8ec934e1.jpg)\n\nFundamentally, Floppy Butt happens when your back rise is too long. One bespoke tailor tells me this is because, when a back rise is too short, the wearer can start to feel a bit of tightness at his lap, which is more noticeable than something he may never even see. [Jeffery Diduch](http://tuttofattoamano.blogspot.com)\n, Vice President of Technical Design and Quality at [Hickey Freeman](https://hickeyfreeman.com/)\n, says this is half the story when it comes to designing ready-to-wear clothes. \n\n> When you’re designing ready-to-wear, if you cut for the average in any given size, then half the men will be smaller, and half will be bigger. You’re far more likely to walk a sale if something is too tight than if it’s too big. Men tend to prefer comfort. And, in any case, you can take in things that are a little too big, but if something is too small, you may be stuck. A short back rise can cause not only tightness in the lap but also wedgies and creeping up the butt, which men really hate. So it is common to err on the side of “too big” or “too long,” rather than “too short.”\n\nOne way to solve this is to wear fishtail trousers and suspenders, such as you see on [Voxsartoria](http://voxsartoria.com)\n above. This combination hikes the trousers up from behind. Depending on how much fullness needs to be taken up, I also find that regular trousers with suspenders can cause the pants to hang better ([I wear Albert Thurston’s](https://www.skoaktiebolaget.com/collections/albert-thurston)\n). But for good reasons, many men feel suspenders are fusty, old-fashioned, and cumbersome. Plus, if you don’t wear a suit jacket or sport coat, suspenders can make you look like a hip bartender at an expensive Brooklyn speakeasy. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b37956a4247d656d8b5fe711fed2164/593eebd830229976-ef/s540x810/1b5b412c1d2f32bb2f496dfbad506268d075b9ac.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b13c0ce0d27e7b821d9adc8cdeefe43c/593eebd830229976-77/s540x810/58dd890c482077730d90689402878a5bffaa399c.jpg)\n\nAlternatively, you can have a tailor shorten the back rise. (Lino Pommella, the cutter behind [Pommella Napoli](https://pommellanapoli.com/)\n, can be seen doing this on a pair of bespoke trousers above, but the process is also possible in ready-to-wear). In these cases, the tailor will pin the seat up closer to the waistband. In doing so, the pants end up sitting at the same place on your waist, but there’s less excess material to fold under your seat.\n\nThere’s a catch. When shortening the back rise, you often have to let out the crotch seam, so the crotch point drops down and doesn’t give the wearer a wedgie. This, however, assumes there’s enough material inside (what tailors call seam allowance). Ryan Devens, owner and founder of [Tailors’ Keep in San Francisco](http://www.tailorskeep.com/)\n, says this will depend on the pants. On lower-priced models, such as what you’ll find at [Uniqlo](https://rstyle.me/+aKX_AnwlkOxMyjY4eWaDqw)\n, there’s often not enough material inside since manufacturers are trying to save on cost. Higher-end, pants, on the other hand, will. “[Rotas from No Man Walks Alone are especially good](https://bit.ly/319vC9S)\n,” he recommends. “Letting out the crotch independently can also be a way to give someone a higher rise.” \n\nIn the photos above, you can see the before-and-after transformation of this kind of alteration. The olive green chinos on the left have a bit of fullness around the seat, crumpling under the butt, and rippling down the leg. Once you shorten the back rise and let out the crotch seam, however, all that gets cleaned up. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/50bb3d88786de5ae761303da524309d4/593eebd830229976-23/s540x810/98a8424c9e05e1d367b4877b263ac45ce314b920.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/997935a2392830f8911caae92cf51262/593eebd830229976-4e/s540x810/71f0a42ee2e6352c34d491a0c546c2f43e006258.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/aae74c4f02ac058d2b678adff7db0e7d/593eebd830229976-85/s540x810/f4d3f850b29fe1d455135d863dd3cf60e551c8eb.jpg)\n\nA few months ago, I interviewed Ryan for a [post at Put This On about how trousers should fit](https://putthison.com/a-bespoke-tailor-explains-how-trousers-should-fit/)\n. Truthfully, that whole post could have been condensed to just Floppy Butt since this is the main issue that, I think, affects everyone. A member at the tailoring forum [The Cutter and Tailor](http://www.cutterandtailor.com/forum/index.php)\n once suggested this is because most people are sedentary and spend their entire day sitting down. Consequently, they have weaker leg muscles and need to stand with their hips forward and knees locked to balance themselves. If someone stands like this, and the trousers aren’t cut for their posture, you’ll see excess fabric crumple below the seat and ripple down the back of the legs. Jeffrey, however, notes that trousers are designed this way on purpose — you just need to know how to get it altered if it bothers you.\n\nGetting this adjustment can be a bit expensive since it involves multiple steps. I don’t think it’s that big of a deal in casualwear since casual outfits don’t have to fit perfectly (depending on the style, a bit of rumpling and idiosyncrasy may even look better).

So long as I could comfortably close the waist and the pants didn’t fall down, they fit. Then I learned about Floppy Butt, also known as the “silent killer of silhouettes.” Hidden behind people, unseen without special mirrors, Floppy Butt all too often goes undetected. Truth be told, I still suffer from Floppy Butt — my butt, indeed, is very floppy. But the condition no longer shows up in my pants, which is the important thing. \n\nFloppy Butt is a technical term, not a colloquial one, for when you have horseshoe-shaped folds underneath your seat (a polite person’s way of saying butt, which is rude). The condition is often accompanied by ripples down the back of the legs and fullness around the seat (again, butt, or in the Queen’s English, arse). It can be difficult to spot this at home with a regular mirror. When you crane your back to see how you look from behind, you’ve already distorted your silhouette. Better if you can find a three-way mirror, say when you’re walking through a department store. Or, if you have friends and family members, ask them to inspect your posterior (i.e., seat, butt, and arse).\n\nIt brings me no joy to say this, but you probably suffer from Floppy Butt without even knowing it. Much like how a suit jacket hangs from the shoulders, trousers hang from the waistband — and the rise determines where the waistband rests. Swing this delicate balance scale in one direction or the other, and suddenly, things can get distorted. You may have Floppy Butt because your trousers are too large for your pancaked-shaped seat (no judgement, as my seat is inverted like crescent-shaped Florentine lapels). Or, like most men, you stand with your hips forward and knees locked (a posture my friend David describes as Auditioning Male Pornstar).\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82df52835128d1c0282f335cd931f5b5/593eebd830229976-fe/s540x810/0c5ca26d929ef559d07b10edba1d24832e8b750c.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ae3931d5d0d70800c7c826ae3c121ac/593eebd830229976-91/s540x810/bd2765a4c4de2db8abcddc3625939dac8ec934e1.jpg)\n\nFundamentally, Floppy Butt happens when your back rise is too long. One bespoke tailor tells me this is because, when a back rise is too short, the wearer can start to feel a bit of tightness at his lap, which is more noticeable than something he may never even see. [Jeffery Diduch](http://tuttofattoamano.blogspot.com)\n, Vice President of Technical Design and Quality at [Hickey Freeman](https://hickeyfreeman.com/)\n, says this is half the story when it comes to designing ready-to-wear clothes. \n\n> When you’re designing ready-to-wear, if you cut for the average in any given size, then half the men will be smaller, and half will be bigger. You’re far more likely to walk a sale if something is too tight than if it’s too big. Men tend to prefer comfort. And, in any case, you can take in things that are a little too big, but if something is too small, you may be stuck. A short back rise can cause not only tightness in the lap but also wedgies and creeping up the butt, which men really hate. So it is common to err on the side of “too big” or “too long,” rather than “too short.”\n\nOne way to solve this is to wear fishtail trousers and suspenders, such as you see on [Voxsartoria](http://voxsartoria.com)\n above. This combination hikes the trousers up from behind. Depending on how much fullness needs to be taken up, I also find that regular trousers with suspenders can cause the pants to hang better ([I wear Albert Thurston’s](https://www.skoaktiebolaget.com/collections/albert-thurston)\n). But for good reasons, many men feel suspenders are fusty, old-fashioned, and cumbersome. Plus, if you don’t wear a suit jacket or sport coat, suspenders can make you look like a hip bartender at an expensive Brooklyn speakeasy. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b37956a4247d656d8b5fe711fed2164/593eebd830229976-ef/s540x810/1b5b412c1d2f32bb2f496dfbad506268d075b9ac.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b13c0ce0d27e7b821d9adc8cdeefe43c/593eebd830229976-77/s540x810/58dd890c482077730d90689402878a5bffaa399c.jpg)\n\nAlternatively, you can have a tailor shorten the back rise. (Lino Pommella, the cutter behind [Pommella Napoli](https://pommellanapoli.com/)\n, can be seen doing this on a pair of bespoke trousers above, but the process is also possible in ready-to-wear). In these cases, the tailor will pin the seat up closer to the waistband. In doing so, the pants end up sitting at the same place on your waist, but there’s less excess material to fold under your seat.\n\nThere’s a catch. When shortening the back rise, you often have to let out the crotch seam, so the crotch point drops down and doesn’t give the wearer a wedgie. This, however, assumes there’s enough material inside (what tailors call seam allowance). Ryan Devens, owner and founder of [Tailors’ Keep in San Francisco](http://www.tailorskeep.com/)\n, says this will depend on the pants. On lower-priced models, such as what you’ll find at [Uniqlo](https://rstyle.me/+aKX_AnwlkOxMyjY4eWaDqw)\n, there’s often not enough material inside since manufacturers are trying to save on cost. Higher-end, pants, on the other hand, will. “[Rotas from No Man Walks Alone are especially good](https://bit.ly/319vC9S)\n,” he recommends. “Letting out the crotch independently can also be a way to give someone a higher rise.” \n\nIn the photos above, you can see the before-and-after transformation of this kind of alteration. The olive green chinos on the left have a bit of fullness around the seat, crumpling under the butt, and rippling down the leg. Once you shorten the back rise and let out the crotch seam, however, all that gets cleaned up. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/50bb3d88786de5ae761303da524309d4/593eebd830229976-23/s540x810/98a8424c9e05e1d367b4877b263ac45ce314b920.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/997935a2392830f8911caae92cf51262/593eebd830229976-4e/s540x810/71f0a42ee2e6352c34d491a0c546c2f43e006258.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/aae74c4f02ac058d2b678adff7db0e7d/593eebd830229976-85/s540x810/f4d3f850b29fe1d455135d863dd3cf60e551c8eb.jpg)\n\nA few months ago, I interviewed Ryan for a [post at Put This On about how trousers should fit](https://putthison.com/a-bespoke-tailor-explains-how-trousers-should-fit/)\n. Truthfully, that whole post could have been condensed to just Floppy Butt since this is the main issue that, I think, affects everyone. A member at the tailoring forum [The Cutter and Tailor](http://www.cutterandtailor.com/forum/index.php)\n once suggested this is because most people are sedentary and spend their entire day sitting down. Consequently, they have weaker leg muscles and need to stand with their hips forward and knees locked to balance themselves. If someone stands like this, and the trousers aren’t cut for their posture, you’ll see excess fabric crumple below the seat and ripple down the back of the legs.

Take David Ricardo, for instance, the British political economist who transformed the world at age 37 after reading Adam Smith’s _[Wealth of Nations](https://rstyle.me/+PHVRXhdP0j4FRPTHZ0cuTw)\n_. Having already made a fortune as a stockbroker and loan broker, Richardo published his first political economy paper on the “bullion controversy” in 1809. He posited that the Bank of England’s propensity to issue excess banknotes was causing inflation, an early theory in what is today known as monetarism. A few years later, in his [“Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock,”](http://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/368/368RicardoCornLawstable.pdf)\n he articulated the law of diminishing marginal returns.\n\nHis most significant contribution, however, came when he studied Britain’s protectionist Corn Laws. Using the simple, yet profound example of how Britain could trade cloth for Portuguese wine, he formulated the idea of comparative advantage — the basis for much of free trade thinking today. Like other great political economy theorists before him, such as Adam Smith and Karl Marx, Ricardo had the uncanny ability to arrive at complex conclusions without the mathematical tools deemed essential in today’s academic research. In his book _[Price Theory](https://rstyle.me/+1VL9gDRn4sT4ftMxk7MuCw)\n_, David Friedman wrote of the man: “The modern economist reading Ricardo’s _[Principles](https://rstyle.me/+vUf7V57ZXU20V6xzSzBfZw)\n_ feels rather as a member of one of the Mount Everest expeditions would feel if, arriving at the top of the mountain, he encountered a hiker clad in T-shirt and tennis shoes.”\n\nRicardo’s examples, however, were not arbitrary. Portugal at the time was renowned for its sweet port wine, and Britain excelled at producing woolens, linens, cottons, silks, and all things textile related. In the Scottish Border towns, tweeds and cashmere were woven and knitted from local and native wools. Further south, Manchester’s steam-driven textile mills produced almost a third of the world’s cotton, thus giving the city its nickname, Cottonpolis. Spitalfields, similarly, was known for its exquisite and lustrous silk. French Protestant refugees (Huguenots) in the 17th century established the silk trade in this East London district after fleeing from religious persecution. The tradition was later taken up by Irish immigrants who arrived with little more than their weaving skills. It was a simple example involving Britain’s textile industries that helped to set up the following 200+ years of economic theory.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2016a8c764905e54c90f3e588b11dd8/f1bd84f4562d3d74-e5/s540x810/78ad03a38b4a4b984eae8687e7071be058b2ef39.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/10ced6974e7bbf571628aff01d6e43ad/f1bd84f4562d3d74-d9/s540x810/02cf36098825b88189464908ee5560b099d75fa5.jpg)\n\nToday, only a shell of those industries remain. As British manufacturing has given way to knowledge-intensive services, production has moved overseas to take advantage of lower-cost labor (comparative advantage rears its head again). Most British textile mills and clothing factories have long-shuttered, but the ones that remain often employ creative strategies to survive in today’s globalized economy. [Drake’s](https://www.drakes.com/usa/)\n, for example, has transformed from a private-label wholesale manufacturer into a full-fledged clothing brand. They also started in East London in 1977, just a stone’s throw away from the city’s silk weaving roots in Spitalfields. And when legendary Macclesfield silk printer [David Evans shuttered in 2002](https://dieworkwear.com/post/55697983578/english-silk-the-craft-of-hand-block-printing)\n, part of their archive went to Drake’s, where the designs live on.\n\nFifteen years ago, few people would have heard of Drake’s. The British tiemaker’s name occasionally showed up on co-branded neckwear labels, such as the ones you might find at Barney’s, Bergdorf Goodman, and Isetan in Japan. But for the most part, the company relied on their hush-hush, private label wholesale business. They supplied both high fashion boutiques and conservative tailoring houses with what they described as men’s “Scarves, Shawls, and Plaids.” To this day, you can still tell when a vintage tie, pocket square, or scarf originated at Drake’s. If the tiny black label has the initials MD, which stands for the company founder Michael Drake, the item was either designed or manufactured at this busy London factory.\n\nLike other European factories, such as [Private White VC](https://rstyle.me/+IQKYzeOYtUc48EDTqIg_2A)\n, [Bresciani](https://therake.com/brands/bresciani.html)\n, and [Simonnot Godard](https://rstyle.me/+3KIOc8NYu7lYHkpB5apk2g)\n, Drake’s has had to be less shy about manufacturing things under their name. Today, they leverage their manufacturing know-how, design things with their vision, and sell goods with their label. The model has proven successful. Their lookbooks have become much-anticipated drops among menswear enthusiasts. The company has stores in London, New York City, Tokyo, Paris, and Seoul. Later this month, they’ll also be moving their Clifford Street flagship to No. 9 Savile Row, right next to military tailors [Dege & Skinner](https://dege-skinner.co.uk/)\n. For decades, Drake’s supplied many of the Golden Mile’s bespoke tailoring houses with their ready-made accessories. But soon, they’ll be selling alongside them as a Savile Row clothier.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a090032ae72e6a1d0c0d5fd0da564e2/f1bd84f4562d3d74-c2/s540x810/6604a11d647eb05ea88e2e6c09e4e63eca819fa3.jpg)\n\n“The new shop is no more than 100 meters from our old location, but it’s four times the size,” says Michael Hill, Drake’s Creative Director. “Now that there’s a bit more in our collection, the new store will allow us to showcase our whole line. We’ve been busy buying furnishings and getting custom cabinets made from Austrian larch timber. The store is long and narrow and has a skylight at the back. I keep joking that we’re going to put a forest in there, but it will be very lush and green. Fingers crossed, it should be open by the end of this month, along with a new website. ”\n\nLast week, they released their latest fall/ winter lookbook, which features photos of their expanding casualwear line. Forty years ago, founder Michael Drake made a name for himself by wearing English flannel trousers with soft Italian sport coats, American button-down collars, and purple wool socks before these things became internet memes. Drake’s new casualwear collection expands on that same playful ethos. “We try to make beautiful clothes that are very thoughtful and considered,” Michael explains. “At the same time, we try not to take ourselves too seriously. We like things that are colorful, joyful, and fun.”\n\nDrake’s has not only helped keep British manufacturing alive, but also classic men’s style relevant. Like how many men my age were first introduced to oxford button-downs and tweed jackets not at Brooks Brothers, but Ralph Lauren, I suspect Drake’s is doing the same for a younger generation, but without the aspirational appeals to gentility. Drake’s has a knack for making classic style feel approachable, not old or fusty, which is crucial if we want such things to survive.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd1e36e0f943756a01f1b3e689087a46/f1bd84f4562d3d74-fe/s540x810/32203dcc76a2d62d31afb39c789fbeaa6dfaa4b4.png)\n\nThis season’s lookbook, shot in Northern Ireland, at a country house an hour outside of Belfast, exhibits that same playful sensibility. There’s the usual run of beautifully made accessories and tailoring, along with more casual items such as Aran knits, Casentino sportswear, and five-pocket cords. Most seasonal collections this time of year feel dour and brooding, perhaps to match the cool-weather conditions. [John Keats’ 1819 poem “To Autumn”](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44484/to-autumn)\n is characterized by intense, painful feelings of melancholic reflection, just as [William Butler Yeats’ “The Wild Swans at Coole”](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43288/the-wild-swans-at-coole)\n compares the maturing season to one’s aging self (“Delight men’s eyes when I awake some day/ To find \\[the swans\\] have flown away?” he wrote).\n\nDrake’s lookbook, on the other hand, is much more upbeat and celebratory. The cheerful, smiling models are shown wearing everything from washable cotton suits to madras-red parkas. The lookbook moves more in tempo with autumn’s lush abundance, rather than the winter’s dreary decay. “This kind of presentation just feels very natural to us because it’s who we are. Everyone is friends with each other, and we wanted to have fun with it,” Michael says of the lookbook presentation. “If we did anything else, it would feel too serious and austere.” I sat down with Michael last week to talk about the new collection, as well as some style lessons readers can glean from the photos.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e253900c6eb9b45e1a097d402126aa4e/f1bd84f4562d3d74-0b/s540x810/e88d9560f8b0462f0f7317ca0dddd15491c55c91.png)\n\n**SPORT COATS WITH JEANS**\n\nOver the years, my position on how to wear sport coats with jeans has softened a bit. I still find that men all too often rely on this combination because they think it helps dress down tailoring. But, more often than not, the combo looks like a mullet — all dressy up top, too casual down bottom.\n\nThe key to making these outfits work is in the cut of the clothes. [Drake’s slim-straight-legged jeans](https://www.drakes.com/usa/catalogsearch/result/?q=jeans)\n, which have been recently redesigned, are a little higher in the rise and fuller in the thigh without looking like middle-aged dad-coverings. At the same time, their sport coats are a little sportier, softer, and more casual. “I wear all our sport coats with denim, [but tweed is the easiest](https://www.drakes.com/usa/clothing/blazers/wheat-herringbone-wool-tweed-jacket)\n,” says Michael. “I suppose there are two types of tweed — those with a spongey hand and others that are more tightly woven. Either would work with jeans, but a Shetland is a little looser set and more rugged, which makes it a particularly good pairing.\" \n\nDouble-breasted sport coats can be scary enough, but tack on gleaming brass buttons and many men become afraid of looking like they’re in costume. The one above from Drake’s, however, is made with a slightly shorter silhouette, which makes it look a little more modern. \"We commissioned custom buttons through this old Birmingham button maker,” Michael says of the brass button design, which are casted with Drake’s original crest. “With denim, it’s the high-low thing we like. You can put that with a flannel shirt and jeans, or with a dress shirt and some trousers. I struggle to think what a navy DB blazer can’t be worn with.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ede680389445dd6155969e8baa9aca8/f1bd84f4562d3d74-a3/s540x810/f0ca19101232bfc2a9bc8dbbc59ebcc918fe3fd6.png)\n\n**FIVE-POCKET CORDS**\n\nIf denim with sport coats don’t appeal to you, consider five-pocket cords, which sit in the middle in terms of formality. [Drake’s cords are made from a deadstock Japanese selvedge cloth](https://www.drakes.com/usa/catalogsearch/result/?q=five+pocket+corduroy+trousers)\n and sewn at the same north England factory that produces their jeans. The selvedge cords have that bit of vintage sensibility that repro-workwear aficionados geek over, but are meant for a dressier crowd. “If you’re headed somewhere where you think denim might be inappropriate, five-pocket cords are the perfect solution,” Michael recommends. “Tailored cords can be incredibly handsome with a tailored jacket, but they’re just a bit more formal. When your trousers are a little easier in their sensibility, it just helps dress down a sport coat that much more.”\n\n[I like five-pocket cords most in rust brown](https://www.drakes.com/usa/brown-japanese-selvedge-corduroy-five-pocket-trousers)\n, but the lookbook features them in a [surprising shade of white](https://www.drakes.com/usa/ecru-japanese-selvedge-corduroy-5-pocket-trousers)\n. “People think that white trousers are difficult, but if you put them in five-pocket cords, the color can be very versatile,” says Michael. “You may think it’s only for spring/ summer, but on dry autumn days, I think they can be quite neutral. I would team them with everything from navy sport coats to tweeds, seed stitch jumpers to [blanket-lined blousons](https://www.drakes.com/usa/brown-japanese-corduroy-blanket-blouson)\n.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/91792d988e896040744d19e59017b876/f1bd84f4562d3d74-f5/s540x810/d4b2e4aa3742bcfcc77b22b3f274ae6a1cbcfc31.png)\n\n**CASENTINO REMIXED**\n\nMen love to obsess over the texture of clothes, perhaps because men’s style is so limited in terms of color and patterns. When it comes to tailoring, few fabrics are as beautifully textured as Casentino wool, a material that comes from a Tuscan region of the same name. The effect comes from the little ringlets that fly off the fabric’s surface. During the Middle Ages, when monks used the cloth for robes, the texture was achieved by beating a fresh length of wool with a wooden stick (today it’s done with machines). The process makes the wool both warmer and more durable, which is why Florentine men later used it for their double-breasted overcoats, often in bright orange. \n\nSometime last year, Michael was looking over some freshly delivered Casentino swatches with a colleague. That morning, he had arrived at his London office in a navy Boston Running Club track jacket, which he’s owned for ages. The process of looking over those swatches above his three-quarter zip gave him an idea. “I was like ‘hold on a minute, should we try this for a laugh?’” [he said of the new Casentino pullover](https://rstyle.me/+2SW3UAapKpp1GG8As1ZiQQ)\n. “I don’t think we’ve ever been as excited about anything. As a piece of sportswear, it’s a little outside of what we traditionally do. But it’s also made from a fabric that has a bit of sartorial history. We think it’s a fun jacket to wear out on a ski resort or in the morning when you’re getting coffee.”\n\n[I also love the raglan-sleeved Casentino overcoat this season](https://www.drakes.com/usa/navy-casentino-boucle-wool-raglan-overcoat)\n. Wrapped around you with a chunky sweater underneath, it looks as though it would feel as reassuring as wearing a heavy blanket. “We tweaked the collar a bit on this season’s overcoat, but it’s similar to previous seasons’ pattern.” The sizeable reverse pleat at the back gives you movement, while the A-line silhouette adds shape without needing to cinch the waist. For fall/ winter, few things look as flattering as a roomy overcoat. This one is just textured. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6fd5cbe25e159e8f992a4a899773121e/f1bd84f4562d3d74-9b/s540x810/8181c795c81f1aa15d9c6a4878f551e6c3f310a4.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ec967bb8d18db0fde8d6fe74ebc6933/f1bd84f4562d3d74-86/s540x810/1f330999ec654e4522118a189be1e1e887620f02.png)\n\n**EARLY FALL, LATE WINTER**\n\nDressing well for the second half of the year involves contending with the ridiculous weather pattern shifts that can happen from fall to winter. Autumn these days can be unseasonably warm, but things can turn on a dime at the onset of winter. When I think back to the legendary tailoring blog A Suitable Wardrobe, I suspect there was some wisdom in Will Bolhke saying that cotton suits are among his favorite garments for fall. More than just a spring/ summer piece, they’re a shoulder season garment for people who live in temperate climates such as the Bay Area.\n\n[Drake’s cotton suits this season](https://www.drakes.com/usa/catalogsearch/result/?q=games+)\n, which come in dark blue and olive green, are machine washable. There’s no haircloth, canvassing, wadding, or shoulder pads inside, which means you can pop them right into the laundry along with your shirts. “I’ve washed mine two or three times now,” says Michael. “You can put them on a hanger afterward to drip dry. You may want to put a crease in the trousers, but I just fold mine over, so they form a loose crease.” As fully unstructured jackets, these will wear more like casual outerwear than [Drake’s slightly more traditional cotton tailoring](https://www.drakes.com/usa/green-cotton-twill-suit)\n. \n\nFor colder conditions, [Drake’s expedition parka](https://www.drakes.com/usa/dusty-red-needlecord-expedition-parka)\n is cut from a textured needlecord and then generously filled with down to create a pleasingly voluminous effect. “I used to love that old Eddie Bauer stuff as a kid,” Michael says. “Down jackets today can look kind of technical. We wanted this one to be a bit more old school. We think of this color as Indian pink. It’s like that red garment that has been out in the sun for too long, or something you’ve owned for many years and the color has washed out. We labbed it and found the perfect shade to create that look. It has a showerproof finish, sheepskin collar, brushed tattersall lining, and some hidden zips.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/95c541199d79895a54370722a3f1ad83/f1bd84f4562d3d74-cc/s540x810/f5255bbcf1912380deb7607073578891a8fb8034.png)\n\n**STILL TO COME**\n\nDrake’s has some other things coming down the pipeline. As usual, some artist collaborations will show up in the form of pocket squares. They’ve also put together some exclusive looks for [The Rake](https://therake.com/)\n, which will include shirts, ties, and suits. But perhaps most exciting of all is the coming collaboration with [Aimé Leon Dore](https://rstyle.me/+f_Xzw8M6Ds5OFZKz3C99oA)\n, a leading streetwear brand based in New York City. \n\n“I think they could be the next Supreme,” predicts Michael. “While we’re very different companies, we have a mutual appreciation for each other and share many of the same values. That one will be a broader collection with caps, shirts, and a soft tailored jacket.” This isn’t Drake’s first collaboration with a fashion brand – they did some knitted scarves with Comme des Garçons about 15 years ago. But it feels particularly well-suited for the times given the increasingly porous border between streetwear and traditional menswear. “We’re a bit more sartorial, and they’re a bit more casual, but I think that kind of collaboration is healthy.” That refreshing sense of open-mindedness is one of the many things I love about this company. \n\nAnd for next fall? Michael says they have a teddy-bear-styled polo coat in the works, along with a beige-brown tweed Balmacaan coat. “The bal coat will have a strong and slightly hairy glen check,” says Michael. As someone who’s been looking for a tweed Balmacaan for a while, I can’t

academia, and particularly social science, research methods have become more rigorous, but the field has produced fewer big thinkers. Take David Ricardo, for instance, the British political economist who transformed the world at age 37 after reading Adam Smith’s _[Wealth of Nations](https://rstyle.me/+PHVRXhdP0j4FRPTHZ0cuTw)\n_. Having already made a fortune as a stockbroker and loan broker, Richardo published his first political economy paper on the “bullion controversy” in 1809. He posited that the Bank of England’s propensity to issue excess banknotes was causing inflation, an early theory in what is today known as monetarism. A few years later, in his [“Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock,”](http://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/368/368RicardoCornLawstable.pdf)\n he articulated the law of diminishing marginal returns.\n\nHis most significant contribution, however, came when he studied Britain’s protectionist Corn Laws. Using the simple, yet profound example of how Britain could trade cloth for Portuguese wine, he formulated the idea of comparative advantage — the basis for much of free trade thinking today. Like other great political economy theorists before him, such as Adam Smith and Karl Marx, Ricardo had the uncanny ability to arrive at complex conclusions without the mathematical tools deemed essential in today’s academic research. In his book _[Price Theory](https://rstyle.me/+1VL9gDRn4sT4ftMxk7MuCw)\n_, David Friedman wrote of the man: “The modern economist reading Ricardo’s _[Principles](https://rstyle.me/+vUf7V57ZXU20V6xzSzBfZw)\n_ feels rather as a member of one of the Mount Everest expeditions would feel if, arriving at the top of the mountain, he encountered a hiker clad in T-shirt and tennis shoes.”\n\nRicardo’s examples, however, were not arbitrary. Portugal at the time was renowned for its sweet port wine, and Britain excelled at producing woolens, linens, cottons, silks, and all things textile related. In the Scottish Border towns, tweeds and cashmere were woven and knitted from local and native wools. Further south, Manchester’s steam-driven textile mills produced almost a third of the world’s cotton, thus giving the city its nickname, Cottonpolis. Spitalfields, similarly, was known for its exquisite and lustrous silk. French Protestant refugees (Huguenots) in the 17th century established the silk trade in this East London district after fleeing from religious persecution. The tradition was later taken up by Irish immigrants who arrived with little more than their weaving skills. It was a simple example involving Britain’s textile industries that helped to set up the following 200+ years of economic theory.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2016a8c764905e54c90f3e588b11dd8/f1bd84f4562d3d74-e5/s540x810/78ad03a38b4a4b984eae8687e7071be058b2ef39.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/10ced6974e7bbf571628aff01d6e43ad/f1bd84f4562d3d74-d9/s540x810/02cf36098825b88189464908ee5560b099d75fa5.jpg)\n\nToday, only a shell of those industries remain. As British manufacturing has given way to knowledge-intensive services, production has moved overseas to take advantage of lower-cost labor (comparative advantage rears its head again). Most British textile mills and clothing factories have long-shuttered, but the ones that remain often employ creative strategies to survive in today’s globalized economy. [Drake’s](https://www.drakes.com/usa/)\n, for example, has transformed from a private-label wholesale manufacturer into a full-fledged clothing brand. They also started in East London in 1977, just a stone’s throw away from the city’s silk weaving roots in Spitalfields. And when legendary Macclesfield silk printer [David Evans shuttered in 2002](https://dieworkwear.com/post/55697983578/english-silk-the-craft-of-hand-block-printing)\n, part of their archive went to Drake’s, where the designs live on.\n\nFifteen years ago, few people would have heard of Drake’s. The British tiemaker’s name occasionally showed up on co-branded neckwear labels, such as the ones you might find at Barney’s, Bergdorf Goodman, and Isetan in Japan. But for the most part, the company relied on their hush-hush, private label wholesale business. They supplied both high fashion boutiques and conservative tailoring houses with what they described as men’s “Scarves, Shawls, and Plaids.” To this day, you can still tell when a vintage tie, pocket square, or scarf originated at Drake’s. If the tiny black label has the initials MD, which stands for the company founder Michael Drake, the item was either designed or manufactured at this busy London factory.\n\nLike other European factories, such as [Private White VC](https://rstyle.me/+IQKYzeOYtUc48EDTqIg_2A)\n, [Bresciani](https://therake.com/brands/bresciani.html)\n, and [Simonnot Godard](https://rstyle.me/+3KIOc8NYu7lYHkpB5apk2g)\n, Drake’s has had to be less shy about manufacturing things under their name. Today, they leverage their manufacturing know-how, design things with their vision, and sell goods with their label. The model has proven successful. Their lookbooks have become much-anticipated drops among menswear enthusiasts. The company has stores in London, New York City, Tokyo, Paris, and Seoul. Later this month, they’ll also be moving their Clifford Street flagship to No. 9 Savile Row, right next to military tailors [Dege & Skinner](https://dege-skinner.co.uk/)\n. For decades, Drake’s supplied many of the Golden Mile’s bespoke tailoring houses with their ready-made accessories. But soon, they’ll be selling alongside them as a Savile Row clothier.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a090032ae72e6a1d0c0d5fd0da564e2/f1bd84f4562d3d74-c2/s540x810/6604a11d647eb05ea88e2e6c09e4e63eca819fa3.jpg)\n\n“The new shop is no more than 100 meters from our old location, but it’s four times the size,” says Michael Hill, Drake’s Creative Director. “Now that there’s a bit more in our collection, the new store will allow us to showcase our whole line. We’ve been busy buying furnishings and getting custom cabinets made from Austrian larch timber. The store is long and narrow and has a skylight at the back. I keep joking that we’re going to put a forest in there, but it will be very lush and green. Fingers crossed, it should be open by the end of this month, along with a new website. ”\n\nLast week, they released their latest fall/ winter lookbook, which features photos of their expanding casualwear line. Forty years ago, founder Michael Drake made a name for himself by wearing English flannel trousers with soft Italian sport coats, American button-down collars, and purple wool socks before these things became internet memes. Drake’s new casualwear collection expands on that same playful ethos. “We try to make beautiful clothes that are very thoughtful and considered,” Michael explains. “At the same time, we try not to take ourselves too seriously. We like things that are colorful, joyful, and fun.”\n\nDrake’s has not only helped keep British manufacturing alive, but also classic men’s style relevant. Like how many men my age were first introduced to oxford button-downs and tweed jackets not at Brooks Brothers, but Ralph Lauren, I suspect Drake’s is doing the same for a younger generation, but without the aspirational appeals to gentility. Drake’s has a knack for making classic style feel approachable, not old or fusty, which is crucial if we want such things to survive.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd1e36e0f943756a01f1b3e689087a46/f1bd84f4562d3d74-fe/s540x810/32203dcc76a2d62d31afb39c789fbeaa6dfaa4b4.png)\n\nThis season’s lookbook, shot in Northern Ireland, at a country house an hour outside of Belfast, exhibits that same playful sensibility. There’s the usual run of beautifully made accessories and tailoring, along with more casual items such as Aran knits, Casentino sportswear, and five-pocket cords. Most seasonal collections this time of year feel dour and brooding, perhaps to match the cool-weather conditions. [John Keats’ 1819 poem “To Autumn”](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44484/to-autumn)\n is characterized by intense, painful feelings of melancholic reflection, just as [William Butler Yeats’ “The Wild Swans at Coole”](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43288/the-wild-swans-at-coole)\n compares the maturing season to one’s aging self (“Delight men’s eyes when I awake some day/ To find \\[the swans\\] have flown away?” he wrote).\n\nDrake’s lookbook, on the other hand, is much more upbeat and celebratory. The cheerful, smiling models are shown wearing everything from washable cotton suits to madras-red parkas. The lookbook moves more in tempo with autumn’s lush abundance, rather than the winter’s dreary decay. “This kind of presentation just feels very natural to us because it’s who we are. Everyone is friends with each other, and we wanted to have fun with it,” Michael says of the lookbook presentation. “If we did anything else, it would feel too serious and austere.” I sat down with Michael last week to talk about the new collection, as well as some style lessons readers can glean from the photos.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e253900c6eb9b45e1a097d402126aa4e/f1bd84f4562d3d74-0b/s540x810/e88d9560f8b0462f0f7317ca0dddd15491c55c91.png)\n\n**SPORT COATS WITH JEANS**\n\nOver the years, my position on how to wear sport coats with jeans has softened a bit. I still find that men all too often rely on this combination because they think it helps dress down tailoring. But, more often than not, the combo looks like a mullet — all dressy up top, too casual down bottom.\n\nThe key to making these outfits work is in the cut of the clothes. [Drake’s slim-straight-legged jeans](https://www.drakes.com/usa/catalogsearch/result/?q=jeans)\n, which have been recently redesigned, are a little higher in the rise and fuller in the thigh without looking like middle-aged dad-coverings. At the same time, their sport coats are a little sportier, softer, and more casual. “I wear all our sport coats with denim, [but tweed is the easiest](https://www.drakes.com/usa/clothing/blazers/wheat-herringbone-wool-tweed-jacket)\n,” says Michael. “I suppose there are two types of tweed — those with a spongey hand and others that are more tightly woven. Either would work with jeans, but a Shetland is a little looser set and more rugged, which makes it a particularly good pairing.\" \n\nDouble-breasted sport coats can be scary enough, but tack on gleaming brass buttons and many men become afraid of looking like they’re in costume. The one above from Drake’s, however, is made with a slightly shorter silhouette, which makes it look a little more modern. \"We commissioned custom buttons through this old Birmingham button maker,” Michael says of the brass button design, which are casted with Drake’s original crest. “With denim, it’s the high-low thing we like. You can put that with a flannel shirt and jeans, or with a dress shirt and some trousers. I struggle to think what a navy DB blazer can’t be worn with.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ede680389445dd6155969e8baa9aca8/f1bd84f4562d3d74-a3/s540x810/f0ca19101232bfc2a9bc8dbbc59ebcc918fe3fd6.png)\n\n**FIVE-POCKET CORDS**\n\nIf denim with sport coats don’t appeal to you, consider five-pocket cords, which sit in the middle in terms of formality. [Drake’s cords are made from a deadstock Japanese selvedge cloth](https://www.drakes.com/usa/catalogsearch/result/?q=five+pocket+corduroy+trousers)\n and sewn at the same north England factory that produces their jeans. The selvedge cords have that bit of vintage sensibility that repro-workwear aficionados geek over, but are meant for a dressier crowd. “If you’re headed somewhere where you think denim might be inappropriate, five-pocket cords are the perfect solution,” Michael recommends. “Tailored cords can be incredibly handsome with a tailored jacket, but they’re just a bit more formal. When your trousers are a little easier in their sensibility, it just helps dress down a sport coat that much more.”\n\n[I like five-pocket cords most in rust brown](https://www.drakes.com/usa/brown-japanese-selvedge-corduroy-five-pocket-trousers)\n, but the lookbook features them in a [surprising shade of white](https://www.drakes.com/usa/ecru-japanese-selvedge-corduroy-5-pocket-trousers)\n. “People think that white trousers are difficult, but if you put them in five-pocket cords, the color can be very versatile,” says Michael. “You may think it’s only for spring/ summer, but on dry autumn days, I think they can be quite neutral. I would team them with everything from navy sport coats to tweeds, seed stitch jumpers to [blanket-lined blousons](https://www.drakes.com/usa/brown-japanese-corduroy-blanket-blouson)\n.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/91792d988e896040744d19e59017b876/f1bd84f4562d3d74-f5/s540x810/d4b2e4aa3742bcfcc77b22b3f274ae6a1cbcfc31.png)\n\n**CASENTINO REMIXED**\n\nMen love to obsess over the texture of clothes, perhaps because men’s style is so limited in terms of color and patterns. When it comes to tailoring, few fabrics are as beautifully textured as Casentino wool, a material that comes from a Tuscan region of the same name. The effect comes from the little ringlets that fly off the fabric’s surface. During the Middle Ages, when monks used the cloth for robes, the texture was achieved by beating a fresh length of wool with a wooden stick (today it’s done with machines). The process makes the wool both warmer and more durable, which is why Florentine men later used it for their double-breasted overcoats, often in bright orange. \n\nSometime last year, Michael was looking over some freshly delivered Casentino swatches with a colleague. That morning, he had arrived at his London office in a navy Boston Running Club track jacket, which he’s owned for ages. The process of looking over those swatches above his three-quarter zip gave him an idea. “I was like ‘hold on a minute, should we try this for a laugh?’” [he said of the new Casentino pullover](https://rstyle.me/+2SW3UAapKpp1GG8As1ZiQQ)\n. “I don’t think we’ve ever been as excited about anything. As a piece of sportswear, it’s a little outside of what we traditionally do. But it’s also made from a fabric that has a bit of sartorial history. We think it’s a fun jacket to wear out on a ski resort or in the morning when you’re getting coffee.”\n\n[I also love the raglan-sleeved Casentino overcoat this season](https://www.drakes.com/usa/navy-casentino-boucle-wool-raglan-overcoat)\n. Wrapped around you with a chunky sweater underneath, it looks as though it would feel as reassuring as wearing a heavy blanket. “We tweaked the collar a bit on this season’s overcoat, but it’s similar to previous seasons’ pattern.” The sizeable reverse pleat at the back gives you movement, while the A-line silhouette adds shape without needing to cinch the waist. For fall/ winter, few things look as flattering as a roomy overcoat. This one is just textured. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6fd5cbe25e159e8f992a4a899773121e/f1bd84f4562d3d74-9b/s540x810/8181c795c81f1aa15d9c6a4878f551e6c3f310a4.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ec967bb8d18db0fde8d6fe74ebc6933/f1bd84f4562d3d74-86/s540x810/1f330999ec654e4522118a189be1e1e887620f02.png)\n\n**EARLY FALL, LATE WINTER**\n\nDressing well for the second half of the year involves contending with the ridiculous weather pattern shifts that can happen from fall to winter. Autumn these days can be unseasonably warm, but things can turn on a dime at the onset of winter. When I think back to the legendary tailoring blog A Suitable Wardrobe, I suspect there was some wisdom in Will Bolhke saying that cotton suits are among his favorite garments for fall. More than just a spring/ summer piece, they’re a shoulder season garment for people who live in temperate climates such as the Bay Area.\n\n[Drake’s cotton suits this season](https://www.drakes.com/usa/catalogsearch/result/?q=games+)\n, which come in dark blue and olive green, are machine washable. There’s no haircloth, canvassing, wadding, or shoulder pads inside, which means you can pop them right into the laundry along with your shirts. “I’ve washed mine two or three times now,” says Michael. “You can put them on a hanger afterward to drip dry. You may want to put a crease in the trousers, but I just fold mine over, so they form a loose crease.” As fully unstructured jackets, these will wear more like casual outerwear than [Drake’s slightly more traditional cotton tailoring](https://www.drakes.com/usa/green-cotton-twill-suit)\n. \n\nFor colder conditions, [Drake’s expedition parka](https://www.drakes.com/usa/dusty-red-needlecord-expedition-parka)\n is cut from a textured needlecord and then generously filled with down to create a pleasingly voluminous effect. “I used to love that old Eddie Bauer stuff as a kid,” Michael says. “Down jackets today can look kind of technical. We wanted this one to be a bit more old school. We think of this color as Indian pink. It’s like that red garment that has been out in the sun for too long, or something you’ve owned for many years and the color has washed out. We labbed it and found the perfect shade to create that look. It has a showerproof finish, sheepskin collar, brushed tattersall lining, and some hidden zips.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/95c541199d79895a54370722a3f1ad83/f1bd84f4562d3d74-cc/s540x810/f5255bbcf1912380deb7607073578891a8fb8034.png)\n\n**STILL TO COME**\n\nDrake’s has some other things coming down the pipeline. As usual, some artist collaborations will show up in the form of pocket squares. They’ve also put together some exclusive looks for [The Rake](https://therake.com/)\n, which will include shirts, ties, and suits. But perhaps most exciting of all is the coming collaboration with [Aimé Leon Dore](https://rstyle.me/+f_Xzw8M6Ds5OFZKz3C99oA)\n, a leading streetwear brand based in New York City. \n\n“I think they could be the next Supreme,” predicts Michael. “While we’re very different companies, we have a mutual appreciation for each other and share many of the same values. That one will be a broader collection with caps, shirts, and a soft tailored jacket.” This isn’t Drake’s first collaboration with a fashion brand – they did some knitted scarves with Comme des Garçons about 15 years ago. But it feels particularly well-suited for the times given the increasingly porous border between streetwear and traditional menswear. “We’re a bit more sartorial, and they’re a bit more casual, but I think that kind of collaboration is healthy.” That refreshing sense of open-mindedness is one of the many things I love about this company. \n\nAnd for next fall? Michael says they have a teddy-bear-styled polo coat in the works, along with a beige-brown tweed Balmacaan coat. “The bal coat will have a strong and slightly hairy glen check,” says Michael. As someone who’s been looking for a tweed Balmacaan for a while, I can’t

Superficially, the primary function of an autumn wardrobe is to protect you from cold, wind, and rain. But in a faraway, foreign land, cocooning myself in layers also brought some psychological comfort. The renowned Russian playwright Anton Chekhov – whose haunting and lyrical prose helped define the modern form of short storytelling – wrote about this feeling over 120 years ago in his story, [“The Man in the Case.”](http://livros01.livrosgratis.com.br/ln000387.pdf)\n\n> \\[T\\]wo months ago a man called Byelikov, a colleague of mine, died in our town. You have heard of him, no doubt. He was remarkable for always wearing galoshes and a warm wadded coat, and carrying an umbrella even in the very finest weather. And his umbrella was in a case, and his watch was in a case made of grey chamois leather, and when he took out his penknife to sharpen his pencil, his penknife, too, was in a little case; and his face seemed to be in a case too, because he always hid it in his turned-up collar. He wore dark spectacles and flannel vests, stuffed up his ears with cotton-wool, and when he got into a cab always told the driver to put up the hood. In short, the man displayed a constant and insurmountable impulse to wrap himself in a covering, to make himself, so to speak, a case which would isolate him and protect him from external influences.\n\nThere’s something oddly comforting about fall/ winter clothes, not just in terms of how they keep you warm, but also emotionally protected. Encased in woolens, with a Scottish cashmere scarf around your neck and your coat’s collar turned-up, you feel like you can take on the world. At the same time, there’s something genial about autumnal clothing — materials such as soft cashmere, nubby oxford, and suede leather invite a smile and conversation. The other day, a stranger complimented me on my outfit. It felt warm. \n\nIt doesn’t take much to build a fall wardrobe. All you need is a navy hopsack sport coat, a brown tweed, and some accompanying trousers in hardy materials such as flannel and whipcord. For visual interest, as well as comfort, get some fishermen sweaters you can layer underneath a waxed Barbour. But what to do if you want to expand? I recently spoke to [Mark Cho](https://www.instagram.com/markchodotcom/)\n, co-founder of [The Armoury](https://thearmoury.com/)\n, about his store’s latest lookbook, which is chock full of cool-weather inspiration. We talked about some things you can try this season if you want to reinvent your shell.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/44d2fa2b347e225331a6fe44ef1e6de7/b511ae4d984cdb79-45/s540x810/462624540f53c39fe0c11cb9046ac8beb1df2d1b.jpg)\n\n**WORSTED CHECK JACKETS**\n\nFabrics come in two types: worsted and woolen. Maybe these categories should be renamed to combed and uncombed, however, because it’s the combing process that separates them. Combing wool is exactly what it sounds like. Before wool is spun into yarn, a spinner can separate the fibers by combing the material. This process sets the hairs parallel to each other, as well as removes any of the shorter fibers that would spoil the regularity characteristic of worsted. \n\nAfter the wool has been combed, it’s spun into yarn and then woven into a fabric. And by combing the hairs first, the resulting material will feel a bit smoother and crisper, which is how you get shiny, hard-finished fabrics. Woolens, on the other hand, aren’t put through the same process. Thus, the cloth is spongier and loftier, as the fibers point in every possible direction. To give examples, gabardine is a worsted, while tweed is generally woolen. \n\n“When we put together these seasonal collections, we think about what people can wear to work,” Mark explains. “Sometimes, things that are fuzzy and rustic aren’t well suited to professional environments. In those cases, a fabric with a clean finish and dry hand can work better. This is especially true in places such as Hong Kong, where you don’t want to wear something too heavy.”\n\nIn this regard, this season’s [dressier, red-and-black check sport coat](https://thearmoury.com/collections/sport-coats/products/wool-cashmere-check-model-3-sport-coat?variant=17988917035079)\n stands apart from the rest of your fall wardrobe. The fabric has the same district check you’d expect to see on a traditional tweed, but none of the prickly surface. Instead, it’s made from a smoother, worsted wool, making it something like a citified version of country cloth. It would also make for a great spring jacket. “I’m still wearing a lot of those small check sport coats these days,” Mark adds. “I always try to make sure I have a warm-toned jacket when I’m traveling. I think they work well with denim or light-colored chinos.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b7c5190382821c688e06f7417660db3/b511ae4d984cdb79-19/s540x810/b755801970d9346f584c6706e0bcb099f4d834bb.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/16dbfbfc435240be627ee2e62b39f3bb/b511ae4d984cdb79-97/s540x810/b4868860811c0bc5dbc5359d93291cfe54e79e52.jpg)\n\n**TURTLENECKS**\n\nBack in 1996, Tom Junod wrote a piece for _GQ Magazine_, which was nominated for a National Magazine Award. Simply titled [“My Father’s Fashion Tips,”](https://www.gq.com/story/fashion-generation-tips-national-magazine-award)\n it was about his father’s impeccable style, as well as the opinions of a man who felt strongly about clothes. The article is a wonderful read, and even includes some rules for underwear. But the best part is his father’s unwavering confidence that a turtleneck is the most flattering thing a man can wear – an inflexible and enduring axiom that, Tom writes, his father believed in more than the existence of God. A turtleneck was flattering because it “fits a man in sharp relief and puts his face on a pedestal – first literally, then figuratively.”\n\nIf you, like me, are a bit skeptical of Mr. Junod’s sweeping characterization, [you can always try a discrete rollneck](https://thearmoury.com/collections/knitwear/products/wool-mini-rollneck-sweater?variant=17988803002439)\n, which is rolled at the collar. Besides framing your face, turtlenecks and rollnecks are useful for a secondary reason. In today’s dressed-down world, they can make for a surprisingly good substitute for a tie. They take up the chest area better than an open-necked shirt, which, admittedly, can look like an empty night sky when it’s not decorated with a four-in-hand. The Armoury shows how a thin turtleneck can look when layered underneath a sport coat or topcoat. \n\n“Everyone has their way of wearing turtlenecks,” says Mark. “I like to roll mine as far as I can, to the point where I’m doubling over the turtleneck, and it almost looks like a mock neck. I wear them with a shirt, such that the collar is peeking out a bit, but not so much that the collar points are popping out.” [I find grey to be the most versatile color](https://thearmoury.com/collections/knitwear/products/the-armoury-cashmere-rollneck-sweater?variant=13621449031751)\n, but there’s something special about how a [navy](https://thearmoury.com/collections/knitwear/products/the-armoury-cashmere-rollneck-sweater?variant=13621449228359)\n or bottle green turtleneck looks when worn underneath a grey flannel suit or brown tweed jacket. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/673839a680d0089b18966b081c131783/b511ae4d984cdb79-1c/s540x810/5fb7aa02e841a82e5ee6acd89936763f7d20463f.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73f49304e8fcf7f30542ce9ff0ff95db/b511ae4d984cdb79-3d/s540x810/1a0117915ff803145731233ad849faf079cd14d1.jpg)\n\n**COLD WEATHER OUTERWEAR**\n\nMy version of Junod’s argument is the oversized topcoat, which looks good on practically anyone. It’s something you can wear with chunky knits and raw denim jeans, or paired with a sport coat and flannel trousers. They work in classic men’s style, streetwear, and even the _avant-garde_. It’s one of those grab-and-go pieces that you can always rely on in the morning because you know you’ll look great. \n\nThe Armoury has a whole line of them this season. “This year marks the 5th anniversary of [Coherence](https://thearmoury.com/artisans/coherence)\n. To celebrate, they came up with some limited edition fabrics and we, as their first wholesale customer, had first pick,” says Mark. “[The brown-gray Corb](https://thearmoury.com/search?q=coherence%20corb)\n, which can be seen here on Richard, is made with just a touch of cashmere. Normally, we do this design in grey wool, which is a bit stiff. With a bit of cashmere, this drapes like nylon but has a bit more body and thickness.”\n\nOf all the overcoats this season, [Mark is most enthusiastic about the Marc](https://thearmoury.com/products/coherence-marc-cravecord-coat?variant=12262329745479)\n, which he co-designed with Coherence founder, Kentaro Nakagomi. No, it’s not named so because of Mark Cho, but rather Marcel Duchamp, who was famously photographed while wearing a similar coat. This season’s version is made from a limited edition, dark chocolate brown nylon. It has a double-breasted closure, belted waist, and an A-line silhouette. “It’s similar to a [dispatch coat](https://standardandstrange.com/products/dispatch-rider-coat-brown)\n, but we made some tweaks to it,” says Mark. “Dispatch coats, which is a WWII style, were originally made with a higher waist because men wore them while riding motorcycles. On this design, we lowered the waist, so it sits more at your natural waist. We also hid some of the buttons and details. If you don’t belt it, it looks like a clean A-line coat.”\n\nAs a silky nylon coat, the Marc pairs better with finer fabrics, such as gabardine trousers, worsted suits, and flannel pants. The Corb, on the other hand, can go all the way from a dark navy suit to jeans and sneakers. [My favorite is the wool twill overcoat](https://thearmoury.com/collections/coats-jackets/products/wool-twill-overcoat?variant=30247215366215)\n, which was produced by Ring Jacket in Japan from a Fox Brothers cloth. It has wide lapels, sporty pockets, and Martingale back, which make it very reminiscent of original polo coats. As such, it could be worn with anything from jeans and a Shetland sweater to grey flannels and a tailored jacket.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b1912b41c7b3b3751b07843b2c7a7231/b511ae4d984cdb79-1a/s540x810/e8cde399537fed0e2a84f7d672f5f6b671ba42cd.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9eaf9e0158351e5de586f6e1600f23c1/b511ae4d984cdb79-db/s540x810/b3d1bf5ff9bda8c8c7984e529a3c35c7e079ee7d.jpg)\n\n**WINTER WHIITE TROUSERS**\n\n[Antonio Ciongoli](https://www.instagram.com/akciongoli/)\n, the talented designer behind [18 East](https://18east.co/)\n, is adamant that stone-colored pants are the most versatile thing you can own after blue jeans. “With a white tee? Perfect. Navy sweater? Can do no better. Denim shirt? The best. It’s less severe than white but will make everything you wear up top look fresher. It’s what we at Ralph Lauren called a ‘good taste color,’” he says. \n\n[The Armoury has some this season in reverse moleskin](https://thearmoury.com/collections/trousers/products/the-armoury-x-pommella-reverse-moleskin-aus1-trousers?variant=17988537843783)\n. “It was Jim’s idea,” says Mark. “They’re fuzzy on the inside, harder wearing the outside. Since the nap is on the inside, they’re very warm and comfortable.” Proving Ciongoli’s point, The Armoury’s paired them here with fawn overcoats, grey overcoats, and district checked tweeds. “I think a lot of guys are scared of cream-colored trousers because, in summerweight cotton, they can be a little see-through,” Mark continues “Ours, however, are made from thick cotton. The ways you can combine them are limitless. Brown and navy are pretty classic pairings, but I also like them tone-on-tone, which means something that echos the cream. Cream trousers with this season’s [terracotta sport coat](https://thearmoury.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/wool-silk-cashmere-model-3-sport-coat?variant=18001669259335)\n really brings out those warm colors.” \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c937089f7b4ce95954dfce394617ace9/b511ae4d984cdb79-04/s540x810/1b9e92e6e1fa1dd6793ccc05a840a29f151ff733.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0782c2507131e4b3b9815b4d436e9d64/b511ae4d984cdb79-4a/s540x810/086eb3ef8881a3816c86a5bb2f8ae12e5ca2cebe.jpg)\n\n**INTRODUCING DAYWARE**\n\nMen who favor classic tailoring often struggle when it comes to casualwear for a straightforward reason. Without a suit jacket or sport coat, classic men’s style all too easily devolves into business casual. At the same time, a tailored jacket in classic proportions can look a bit formal in specific settings. The challenge is finding something suitably casual, but also distinctive and stylish.\n\nIn the last few months, The Armoury has been working on a new in-house sportswear line, dubbed DayWare, designed to solve this problem. “DayWare is sportswear for an Armoury customer who wants something to sit alongside their tailored clothing,” explains Mark. “It’s casualwear with classic menswear proportions in mind, as well as more thought put into the details.” [A perfect example is their new jeans designed in collaboration with Nigel Cabourn](https://thearmoury.com/products/the-armoury-by-nigel-cabourn-5-pocket-denim-jeans?variant=17728986415175)\n. The two companies made a slightly higher-rise jean with a tapered leg that customers can wear with either bomber jackets or sport coats. “Our denim is based on a replica pair of vintage denim in Nigel’s archive,” says Mark. “It’s a 12.5oz unsanforized cloth that has a kind of texture and character you don’t see in modern denim.”\n\nDayWare also features two new jackets: [a three-pocket blouson](https://thearmoury.com/collections/coats-jackets/products/made-to-order-3-pocket-blouson?variant=17468448702535)\n, seen above on Mark, as well as a [suede Wright jacket](https://thearmoury.com/search?q=wright)\n. The jackets ride the line when it comes to modern clothing and vintage workwear. “One of our running philosophies is that we like silhouettes to be a little broad at the top and then taper downwards,” explains Mark. “So in tailoring, this would be broad shoulders and long legs. When we designed the Wright jacket, we made it much shorter than the average jacket. At the same time, we brought up the buttoning point and collar. You’d be surprised to see how many jackets are a little too long, and yet saggy at the neck. So we cleaned all that up and gave the pockets side entries so you can use them as hand warmers.”\n\nThe Armoury has other notable new arrivals. [Their new Model 11 jacket is like a hunting version of an American trad sack coat](https://thearmoury.com/search?q=model%2011)\n, which is ideal for guys who want to wear a more casual version of tailored clothing. “It’s a sack jacket, so it doesn’t have any darts in the body,” he said. “The pockets are also pleated, patched, and flapped. We narrowed the lapels and gave the jacket some sharpness throughout. It appeals to tailoring aficionados, as well as people who like tailoring but normally don’t have opportunities to wear it.” [I also love the new short vamp tassel loafers](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1XXRYUhk06/)\n, which would look terrific with a tweed sport coat and grey trousers. Mark says they’ll be ready by the end of the year along with a new DayWare tote bag. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a76b6d4638ae3120ca240cb6c988c26/b511ae4d984cdb79-a3/s540x810/d4b8ec6a6f07267751fd02ee88b233e411f07f70.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a2a007d3798b443954c12abd8ca45d7a/b511ae4d984cdb79-a0/s540x810/3d9b1c4e30c7d08d475516b9d15b8d7e592dc422.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c74d6fb101ac34372a299f1e190f5dca/b511ae4d984cdb79-8c/s540x810/859c097983b54a03da902284eadff068d53611eb.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f06dec2f2071f2532954e8e77ad389da/b511ae4d984cdb79-b3/s540x810/65dc3587e4c31eb6b06234e2ff3ab5a4f860f3dc.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/217de679ad0509b0570aadf2d86629e4/b511ae4d984cdb79-a7/s540x810/f48a46fca3c34219de8a3e15500fc80478f35db0.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a240f098108d69cb22dea1a856864e1c/b511ae4d984cdb79-37/s540x810/c985729224291eb345538a47f81e5949938ca4bd.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cf79690a97011c6244a663e17531985d/b511ae4d984cdb79-55/s540x810/d022f6281cbd9086c18c9df1ffdf095ee14af8dc.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/19f59c2f234198ca4157a1b84c5d38a2/b511ae4d984cdb79-7a/s540x810/461ba0289a2e5797860779daea7e190fcea354b4.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/95099eed1829629896510e81720d7ed9/b511ae4d984cdb79-30/s540x810/9b20b86a9e9f9c2403bee31b01f73518a94b124c.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/084f9f91f3f7633a60f7766d166ccc49/b511ae4d984cdb79-83/s540x810/53cbceb8b6dd9d55d957efc6def5dc0f78223e60.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ce52a6d90669b8f22e22349fdccb2cd/b511ae4d984cdb79-90/s540x810/68e6596aa6d56ad5f5fa47f3b04e0dc716f2e663.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/707a3a2e4b03bbd3ce4f0d62f2d0dda6/b511ae4d984cdb79-10/s540x810/30cf096f43137079ff7fc514249b825db3cadbff.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8448538342d2f8b74011cd95ae7a0993/b511ae4d984cdb79-83/s540x810/b68a5d7d9d63e4c2f9f2bd64891de2b8bd30a7f2.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/12a0cfd5843176ac2069d579971ad676/b511ae4d984cdb79-f9/s540x810/e71b9d079d029a6c410b5baae685b78335a2fec5.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/796f8572e8d3ced61eb0f9c03d8986f3/b511ae4d984cdb79-16/s540x810/0bbc34032158ba10cf9b72c8a1ed9080f79d0259.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/81e1c5d541d24354b409cf981dc6ac4a/b511ae4d984cdb79-21/s540x810/b8592b439d069e542533fdd507b783c0dfb4248f.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1da8d64bbcf82af91e11c3f5d566ad16/b511ae4d984cdb79-1a/s540x810/91dff402a9a4ec41ac430dea70bd4166eaf4c388.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07639a31535fc417e7d238423d3edccf/b511ae4d984cdb79-bc/s540x810/cf8ea313a260646ac192dc7571ff15663e345cc8.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c3e9d52704c321a29e90b8c0790dfbb0/b511ae4d984cdb79-47/s540x810/ea5ed9285cde43aa1a3aed5115430c982769cfaa.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/46bd7dafaa707f62e288ad2f4fda8c2c/b511ae4d984cdb79-ac/s540x810/04bf7ca97b502cc362cb905f9e02ee8d51a5636b.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab23d7b1308debbf48f65c3e31ad362d/b511ae4d984cdb79-99/s540x810/eb737bbd13adc00a3e9a18d6ccf5636ec0439bf2.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0efcc9bf720e797e87a1dfcf0bed8eb1/b511ae4d984cdb79-f4/s540x810/c13d63efcfec2950db7be4aaf8de6ce10a2758b6.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/da41dd8a074d1b61adf37bd7babae961/b511ae4d984cdb79-38/s540x810/3c81eb5a8a5f0477bfe659f14eb32186bf9c0f15.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/77b5c6e0b1d81a0350ce3e6abefc12da/b511ae4d984cdb79-d6/s540x810/fe0ceaa9e81bacb814f05324e0e34884271df3f0.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/775e0ee4ce35caa25ea7fe1cf1cb926c/b511ae4d984cdb79-84/s540x810/eb3f7bf5151038acd3bd6647968d60ad53accc29.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ec36449b42995ef0ab567e6215f7cad/b511ae4d984cdb79-5f/s540x810/b8976adc15a281d8c39f25063149413748e2c357.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/90064199ebe37a0aca964ed8af9e7a38/b511ae4d984cdb79-2a/s540x810/cb2727a116cc9376f971914a993a75f4adf1ca60.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a32c7b88df4aa616e0b68b968df2a813/b511ae4d984cdb79-38/s540x810/b08f6233a82ba8710e926d1ed2d07a3144ce2b83.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4386f7eded0b1e2c87c5c3220f6c883d/b511ae4d984cdb79-ce/s540x810/e8e6b954bbb6cfb8a5fc24cb0260e9c7dd764e99.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f6584c8ad515ffc51e55fd9c72b72060/b511ae4d984cdb79-9c/s540x810/191db0d9bca52cc4676e062b9ebcd2edbd80de92.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/949456a0e8096f050c9a136cff86cc02/b511ae4d984cdb79-65/s540x810/2427abc75bfb3f0d07b918c42b9a7ff5d2062fb9.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e7eb000d6120f5b3e68d4da8c3e9fa96/b511ae4d984cdb79-79/s540x810/b0c6078cc761cd5f61fe7cc70541fa879e57d1e3.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/36e2503134e4a3fca6e869a18b088766/b511ae4d984cdb79-ee/s540x810/c6555e6fc1f44be38dd3ea68382179771d64d2e4.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/666e6423cc6c45836543eb406030a462/b511ae4d984cdb79-93/s540x810/67bcbf2e

I lived in Moscow, Russia many years ago, I relied on my gray flannel trousers, tweed sport coat, and waxed cotton jacket to get me through fall. Superficially, the primary function of an autumn wardrobe is to protect you from cold, wind, and rain. But in a faraway, foreign land, cocooning myself in layers also brought some psychological comfort. The renowned Russian playwright Anton Chekhov – whose haunting and lyrical prose helped define the modern form of short storytelling – wrote about this feeling over 120 years ago in his story, [“The Man in the Case.”](http://livros01.livrosgratis.com.br/ln000387.pdf)\n\n> \\[T\\]wo months ago a man called Byelikov, a colleague of mine, died in our town. You have heard of him, no doubt. He was remarkable for always wearing galoshes and a warm wadded coat, and carrying an umbrella even in the very finest weather. And his umbrella was in a case, and his watch was in a case made of grey chamois leather, and when he took out his penknife to sharpen his pencil, his penknife, too, was in a little case; and his face seemed to be in a case too, because he always hid it in his turned-up collar. He wore dark spectacles and flannel vests, stuffed up his ears with cotton-wool, and when he got into a cab always told the driver to put up the hood. In short, the man displayed a constant and insurmountable impulse to wrap himself in a covering, to make himself, so to speak, a case which would isolate him and protect him from external influences.\n\nThere’s something oddly comforting about fall/ winter clothes, not just in terms of how they keep you warm, but also emotionally protected. Encased in woolens, with a Scottish cashmere scarf around your neck and your coat’s collar turned-up, you feel like you can take on the world. At the same time, there’s something genial about autumnal clothing — materials such as soft cashmere, nubby oxford, and suede leather invite a smile and conversation. The other day, a stranger complimented me on my outfit. It felt warm. \n\nIt doesn’t take much to build a fall wardrobe. All you need is a navy hopsack sport coat, a brown tweed, and some accompanying trousers in hardy materials such as flannel and whipcord. For visual interest, as well as comfort, get some fishermen sweaters you can layer underneath a waxed Barbour. But what to do if you want to expand? I recently spoke to [Mark Cho](https://www.instagram.com/markchodotcom/)\n, co-founder of [The Armoury](https://thearmoury.com/)\n, about his store’s latest lookbook, which is chock full of cool-weather inspiration. We talked about some things you can try this season if you want to reinvent your shell.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/44d2fa2b347e225331a6fe44ef1e6de7/b511ae4d984cdb79-45/s540x810/462624540f53c39fe0c11cb9046ac8beb1df2d1b.jpg)\n\n**WORSTED CHECK JACKETS**\n\nFabrics come in two types: worsted and woolen. Maybe these categories should be renamed to combed and uncombed, however, because it’s the combing process that separates them. Combing wool is exactly what it sounds like. Before wool is spun into yarn, a spinner can separate the fibers by combing the material. This process sets the hairs parallel to each other, as well as removes any of the shorter fibers that would spoil the regularity characteristic of worsted. \n\nAfter the wool has been combed, it’s spun into yarn and then woven into a fabric. And by combing the hairs first, the resulting material will feel a bit smoother and crisper, which is how you get shiny, hard-finished fabrics. Woolens, on the other hand, aren’t put through the same process. Thus, the cloth is spongier and loftier, as the fibers point in every possible direction. To give examples, gabardine is a worsted, while tweed is generally woolen. \n\n“When we put together these seasonal collections, we think about what people can wear to work,” Mark explains. “Sometimes, things that are fuzzy and rustic aren’t well suited to professional environments. In those cases, a fabric with a clean finish and dry hand can work better. This is especially true in places such as Hong Kong, where you don’t want to wear something too heavy.”\n\nIn this regard, this season’s [dressier, red-and-black check sport coat](https://thearmoury.com/collections/sport-coats/products/wool-cashmere-check-model-3-sport-coat?variant=17988917035079)\n stands apart from the rest of your fall wardrobe. The fabric has the same district check you’d expect to see on a traditional tweed, but none of the prickly surface. Instead, it’s made from a smoother, worsted wool, making it something like a citified version of country cloth. It would also make for a great spring jacket. “I’m still wearing a lot of those small check sport coats these days,” Mark adds. “I always try to make sure I have a warm-toned jacket when I’m traveling. I think they work well with denim or light-colored chinos.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b7c5190382821c688e06f7417660db3/b511ae4d984cdb79-19/s540x810/b755801970d9346f584c6706e0bcb099f4d834bb.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/16dbfbfc435240be627ee2e62b39f3bb/b511ae4d984cdb79-97/s540x810/b4868860811c0bc5dbc5359d93291cfe54e79e52.jpg)\n\n**TURTLENECKS**\n\nBack in 1996, Tom Junod wrote a piece for _GQ Magazine_, which was nominated for a National Magazine Award. Simply titled [“My Father’s Fashion Tips,”](https://www.gq.com/story/fashion-generation-tips-national-magazine-award)\n it was about his father’s impeccable style, as well as the opinions of a man who felt strongly about clothes. The article is a wonderful read, and even includes some rules for underwear. But the best part is his father’s unwavering confidence that a turtleneck is the most flattering thing a man can wear – an inflexible and enduring axiom that, Tom writes, his father believed in more than the existence of God. A turtleneck was flattering because it “fits a man in sharp relief and puts his face on a pedestal – first literally, then figuratively.”\n\nIf you, like me, are a bit skeptical of Mr. Junod’s sweeping characterization, [you can always try a discrete rollneck](https://thearmoury.com/collections/knitwear/products/wool-mini-rollneck-sweater?variant=17988803002439)\n, which is rolled at the collar. Besides framing your face, turtlenecks and rollnecks are useful for a secondary reason. In today’s dressed-down world, they can make for a surprisingly good substitute for a tie. They take up the chest area better than an open-necked shirt, which, admittedly, can look like an empty night sky when it’s not decorated with a four-in-hand. The Armoury shows how a thin turtleneck can look when layered underneath a sport coat or topcoat. \n\n“Everyone has their way of wearing turtlenecks,” says Mark. “I like to roll mine as far as I can, to the point where I’m doubling over the turtleneck, and it almost looks like a mock neck. I wear them with a shirt, such that the collar is peeking out a bit, but not so much that the collar points are popping out.” [I find grey to be the most versatile color](https://thearmoury.com/collections/knitwear/products/the-armoury-cashmere-rollneck-sweater?variant=13621449031751)\n, but there’s something special about how a [navy](https://thearmoury.com/collections/knitwear/products/the-armoury-cashmere-rollneck-sweater?variant=13621449228359)\n or bottle green turtleneck looks when worn underneath a grey flannel suit or brown tweed jacket. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/673839a680d0089b18966b081c131783/b511ae4d984cdb79-1c/s540x810/5fb7aa02e841a82e5ee6acd89936763f7d20463f.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73f49304e8fcf7f30542ce9ff0ff95db/b511ae4d984cdb79-3d/s540x810/1a0117915ff803145731233ad849faf079cd14d1.jpg)\n\n**COLD WEATHER OUTERWEAR**\n\nMy version of Junod’s argument is the oversized topcoat, which looks good on practically anyone. It’s something you can wear with chunky knits and raw denim jeans, or paired with a sport coat and flannel trousers. They work in classic men’s style, streetwear, and even the _avant-garde_. It’s one of those grab-and-go pieces that you can always rely on in the morning because you know you’ll look great. \n\nThe Armoury has a whole line of them this season. “This year marks the 5th anniversary of [Coherence](https://thearmoury.com/artisans/coherence)\n. To celebrate, they came up with some limited edition fabrics and we, as their first wholesale customer, had first pick,” says Mark. “[The brown-gray Corb](https://thearmoury.com/search?q=coherence%20corb)\n, which can be seen here on Richard, is made with just a touch of cashmere. Normally, we do this design in grey wool, which is a bit stiff. With a bit of cashmere, this drapes like nylon but has a bit more body and thickness.”\n\nOf all the overcoats this season, [Mark is most enthusiastic about the Marc](https://thearmoury.com/products/coherence-marc-cravecord-coat?variant=12262329745479)\n, which he co-designed with Coherence founder, Kentaro Nakagomi. No, it’s not named so because of Mark Cho, but rather Marcel Duchamp, who was famously photographed while wearing a similar coat. This season’s version is made from a limited edition, dark chocolate brown nylon. It has a double-breasted closure, belted waist, and an A-line silhouette. “It’s similar to a [dispatch coat](https://standardandstrange.com/products/dispatch-rider-coat-brown)\n, but we made some tweaks to it,” says Mark. “Dispatch coats, which is a WWII style, were originally made with a higher waist because men wore them while riding motorcycles. On this design, we lowered the waist, so it sits more at your natural waist. We also hid some of the buttons and details. If you don’t belt it, it looks like a clean A-line coat.”\n\nAs a silky nylon coat, the Marc pairs better with finer fabrics, such as gabardine trousers, worsted suits, and flannel pants. The Corb, on the other hand, can go all the way from a dark navy suit to jeans and sneakers. [My favorite is the wool twill overcoat](https://thearmoury.com/collections/coats-jackets/products/wool-twill-overcoat?variant=30247215366215)\n, which was produced by Ring Jacket in Japan from a Fox Brothers cloth. It has wide lapels, sporty pockets, and Martingale back, which make it very reminiscent of original polo coats. As such, it could be worn with anything from jeans and a Shetland sweater to grey flannels and a tailored jacket.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b1912b41c7b3b3751b07843b2c7a7231/b511ae4d984cdb79-1a/s540x810/e8cde399537fed0e2a84f7d672f5f6b671ba42cd.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9eaf9e0158351e5de586f6e1600f23c1/b511ae4d984cdb79-db/s540x810/b3d1bf5ff9bda8c8c7984e529a3c35c7e079ee7d.jpg)\n\n**WINTER WHIITE TROUSERS**\n\n[Antonio Ciongoli](https://www.instagram.com/akciongoli/)\n, the talented designer behind [18 East](https://18east.co/)\n, is adamant that stone-colored pants are the most versatile thing you can own after blue jeans. “With a white tee? Perfect. Navy sweater? Can do no better. Denim shirt? The best. It’s less severe than white but will make everything you wear up top look fresher. It’s what we at Ralph Lauren called a ‘good taste color,’” he says. \n\n[The Armoury has some this season in reverse moleskin](https://thearmoury.com/collections/trousers/products/the-armoury-x-pommella-reverse-moleskin-aus1-trousers?variant=17988537843783)\n. “It was Jim’s idea,” says Mark. “They’re fuzzy on the inside, harder wearing the outside. Since the nap is on the inside, they’re very warm and comfortable.” Proving Ciongoli’s point, The Armoury’s paired them here with fawn overcoats, grey overcoats, and district checked tweeds. “I think a lot of guys are scared of cream-colored trousers because, in summerweight cotton, they can be a little see-through,” Mark continues “Ours, however, are made from thick cotton. The ways you can combine them are limitless. Brown and navy are pretty classic pairings, but I also like them tone-on-tone, which means something that echos the cream. Cream trousers with this season’s [terracotta sport coat](https://thearmoury.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/wool-silk-cashmere-model-3-sport-coat?variant=18001669259335)\n really brings out those warm colors.” \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c937089f7b4ce95954dfce394617ace9/b511ae4d984cdb79-04/s540x810/1b9e92e6e1fa1dd6793ccc05a840a29f151ff733.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0782c2507131e4b3b9815b4d436e9d64/b511ae4d984cdb79-4a/s540x810/086eb3ef8881a3816c86a5bb2f8ae12e5ca2cebe.jpg)\n\n**INTRODUCING DAYWARE**\n\nMen who favor classic tailoring often struggle when it comes to casualwear for a straightforward reason. Without a suit jacket or sport coat, classic men’s style all too easily devolves into business casual. At the same time, a tailored jacket in classic proportions can look a bit formal in specific settings. The challenge is finding something suitably casual, but also distinctive and stylish.\n\nIn the last few months, The Armoury has been working on a new in-house sportswear line, dubbed DayWare, designed to solve this problem. “DayWare is sportswear for an Armoury customer who wants something to sit alongside their tailored clothing,” explains Mark. “It’s casualwear with classic menswear proportions in mind, as well as more thought put into the details.” [A perfect example is their new jeans designed in collaboration with Nigel Cabourn](https://thearmoury.com/products/the-armoury-by-nigel-cabourn-5-pocket-denim-jeans?variant=17728986415175)\n. The two companies made a slightly higher-rise jean with a tapered leg that customers can wear with either bomber jackets or sport coats. “Our denim is based on a replica pair of vintage denim in Nigel’s archive,” says Mark. “It’s a 12.5oz unsanforized cloth that has a kind of texture and character you don’t see in modern denim.”\n\nDayWare also features two new jackets: [a three-pocket blouson](https://thearmoury.com/collections/coats-jackets/products/made-to-order-3-pocket-blouson?variant=17468448702535)\n, seen above on Mark, as well as a [suede Wright jacket](https://thearmoury.com/search?q=wright)\n. The jackets ride the line when it comes to modern clothing and vintage workwear. “One of our running philosophies is that we like silhouettes to be a little broad at the top and then taper downwards,” explains Mark. “So in tailoring, this would be broad shoulders and long legs. When we designed the Wright jacket, we made it much shorter than the average jacket. At the same time, we brought up the buttoning point and collar. You’d be surprised to see how many jackets are a little too long, and yet saggy at the neck. So we cleaned all that up and gave the pockets side entries so you can use them as hand warmers.”\n\nThe Armoury has other notable new arrivals. [Their new Model 11 jacket is like a hunting version of an American trad sack coat](https://thearmoury.com/search?q=model%2011)\n, which is ideal for guys who want to wear a more casual version of tailored clothing. “It’s a sack jacket, so it doesn’t have any darts in the body,” he said. “The pockets are also pleated, patched, and flapped. We narrowed the lapels and gave the jacket some sharpness throughout. It appeals to tailoring aficionados, as well as people who like tailoring but normally don’t have opportunities to wear it.” [I also love the new short vamp tassel loafers](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1XXRYUhk06/)\n, which would look terrific with a tweed sport coat and grey trousers.

Ward, a bespoke tailoring firm based in London’s Burlington Arcade. Nutter derisively described their house style as “little” and wanted to update it with some flair. The traditional-minded tailors in the workroom, however, dismissed his ideas as technically impossible and, in any case, tasteless. “People did not come here to be measured up for tents,” one journalist documented. So Tommy petitioned for a new job at [Henry Poole](https://henrypoole.com/)\n. When the firm’s managing director, Samuel Cundey, saw Tommy’s fashionably long hair, however, he sent him away, horrified.\n\nTommy would save his ideas for himself. Shortly after quitting his job, he and [Edward Sexton](https://www.edwardsexton.co.uk/)\n went on to form one of the most important tailoring houses of the 20th century, Nutters of Savile Row. If you believe menswear lore, many of the long-standing firms, such as [Huntsman](https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/)\n, viewed Nutters at first with suspicion. Bespoke tailoring at the time was a hush-hush and stuffy business. Tailoring shops didn’t even have display windows and firms such as [Anderson & Sheppard](https://www.anderson-sheppard.co.uk/)\n considered publicity vulgar. The expression “it’s not done” not only sums up the hard-edged attitude of many in the solvent class, but also the tailors who served them.\n\nNutters not only displayed their goods to the public, they also talked to journalists and attracted younger customers into the then-stodgy precincts of Savile Row. They tailored for Elton John, Mick Jagger, and The Beatles, as well as women such as Twiggy and Diana Ross. Men walked out of the Nutters shop clad in box plaid suits, flared pants, and mini-platform shoes. As they strutted down the street, competing tailors stared, mouths agape. Perhaps they were offended by the garish designs. Or maybe they feared Nutters made them look stodgy by comparison.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0342faa1ae5dc4526c5cac69694a6d17/de4f726ac6a16bc6-fb/s540x810/cb35852c558c84080f63e899eec69b6708bc4092.jpg)\n\nAngus Cundey, Samuel’s son, remembers things differently. In an issue of _Men’s Wear,_ he’s quoted as saying: “I would like to see this stuffy image removed from the West End, but in doing so we should not forsake our reputation for quality. I want to show that Savile Row keeps up with the times.” Just three months after Nutters opened, the Cundey family threw a proverbial “brick through their own obscured frontage” and installed a shop window to attract passers-by. Lance Richardson offers an excellent account of Nutter’s history in his book, _[House of Nutters](https://www.amazon.com/House-Nutter-Rebel-Tailor-Savile/dp/0451496469)\n_.  \n\n> Indeed, the Row turned out to be mostly on Tommy’s side. Any skepticism he did experience came predominately from outside — from the media, for instance, which was still pushing (and would continue to push, for decades to come) the idea of the industry in irreversible decline. \\[…\\] Tommy didn’t quite fit into this reductive narrative, so he was condescendingly dismissed, just one of the new “clothes artists” whose shops stood out mostly as “bright parodies of the old style — a sort of Space-Age Regency,” as though the future had no business mingling with a consecrated past.\n\nSince Nutters, tailoring has been reinvented a hundred times over. But at each of these iterations — Armani’s zoot-suit silhouette, Versace’s flashy riposte to Armani’s usual restraint, and Helmut Lang’s austere high-fashion tailoring — the clothes eventually look absurd once the fog of fashion lifts. Consequently, many men have retreated to classic tailoring for fear of looking bad in hindsight.\n\nI think there’s a middle road. There’s nothing wrong with referencing 1930s _Apparel Arts_ catalogs and the heydays of Ivy Style for inspiration. But if you’re looking for a modern take on classic tailoring, stores such as [The Armoury](https://thearmoury.com/)\n, [Drake’s](https://www.drakes.com/)\n, and [BRIO](https://www.instagram.com/briobeijing/)\n are doing a great job of balancing the two poles. These names won’t sound new to anyone who’s been reading men’s style blogs for a while now. But it’s worth noting that their Italian inspired cuts are rooted in tradition while also looking, well, cool and sexy. [Brooks Brothers](https://rstyle.me/+6JgU3jUg7HhAQ2YFeRD8WQ)\n is many things, but it is neither cool nor sexy.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b4326d56ddd4c84ef57fcc4b8c465d7/de4f726ac6a16bc6-42/s540x810/3f2fcbcc081f1da050515c5fa4eb334b70061fb3.jpg)\n\n[Anglo Italian](https://angloitalian.com)\n, a relatively new shop located in London’s Marylebone, is one of those places that’s helping bring a new generation of people into classic tailoring. One of the shop’s co-founders, Jake Grantham, has become a minor internet celebrity, although he’s somewhat media-shy. He doesn’t give many interviews and generally shuns promotion. But he and his business partner Alex Pirounis have a sizable following on Instagram because thousands of young men look to them for style inspiration.\n\n“With classic tailoring, there’s a real risk of looking pastiche,” says Jake. “As a younger guy in my 30s, I need to be able to wear clothes to parties and the pub. I have to be able to do things that guys at my age do. I feel strongly that I shouldn’t walk out of the shop looking like I’ve stepped out of the past. I realize it’s a fine line, but at Anglo Italian, we try to balance classic style with relevance.”\n\nJake has been wearing tailored clothing for much of his life. As a student at King’s College in Wimbledon, he was required to wear a suit at age 16 as part of the school’s uniform. Jake was eager about it, not least because he was also into old gangster films at the time, such as _[White Heat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w3n_eRizgw)\n_ and _[Little Ceaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeGMaVvzUVo)\n_, where the characters all wore dark worsteds with revers. “When you’re 16, you’re looking to give off a certain kind of masculinity, maybe because you’re coming of age and don’t have that sensibility yet. So appearance can be very important to you,” he said.\n\nWith a love for tailoring, Jake decided to pursue a career in the trade at age 18. Initially, he did some odd jobs for various bespoke tailoring shops, cleaning up stockrooms and delivering bunches to coat makers. Two years later, he became a sales associate at the then newly opened Drake’s flagship in London. This was around the time Michael Drake, the firm’s founder, was handing the company’s reins over to Michael Hill, now co-owner and Creative Director. When he graduated college, Mark Cho asked if he’d like to move to Hong Kong to work at The Armoury.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/774a322ebde272d8c6a1874f1729b55f/de4f726ac6a16bc6-fe/s540x810/165687d15f3c6420425bc0315036298a9b736551.jpg)\n\n“Those years were incredible,” Jake says fondly of his former employers. “Michael Drake was a huge influence on me. He was one of the first guys I saw wearing Italian sport coats with American button-downs and English flannel trousers. But he looked so much better than everyone else because his style was softer and more muted. I then spent five years at The Armoury at a time when the company was growing at a real pace, so there was a lot of opportunities. I was able to do a lot of the buying, development, and designing. I was able to go to Milano Unica, a tradeshow for cloth, which is where tailoring begins. If Drake’s was the beginning of my career in this trade, The Armoury allowed me to grow and put some ideas together.”\n\nJake says his style hasn’t changed that much since he was a teen, he’s just honed it. He grew up wearing waxed cotton [Barbour jackets](https://bit.ly/2Pd9r25)\n, [oxford button-downs](https://angloitalian.com/products/ocbd-shirt-ice-blue-oxford)\n, and [boat shoes](https://rstyle.me/+bhsr4WAMwBn8IJenomKZmQ)\n, which he still stands by today. “Maybe things have gotten a little more drapey, but only because I’ve put on weight,” Jake jokes. He says he’s most comfortable in a [navy hopsack sport coat](https://angloitalian.com/products/sport-jacket-wool-house-hopsack-navy)\n, [some grey Fresco trousers](https://angloitalian.com/products/tailored-trouser-twisted-wool-grey)\n, [a button-down oxford shirt](https://angloitalian.com/products/ocbd-shirt-ice-blue-oxford)\n, and [a pair of suede loafers](https://angloitalian.com/products/crockett-jones-bradbourne-loafer-brown-suede)\n. From fall until spring, Jake often wears raglan-sleeve coats, such as Barbour’s field jackets. He also likes five-pocket jeans and prefers button-up shirts in light blue (“they hide dirt better,” he noted, [“especially in reverse stripes”](https://angloitalian.com/products/ocbd-shirt-reverse-stripe-blue-oxford)\n). For casual shoes, he stomps around on weekends in [New Balance sneakers](https://rstyle.me/+H9ihmMgvPktOCkajoyieHw)\n and [Loro Piana’s Open Walks](https://rstyle.me/+wpSANmpatAjuyB7PbosRcA)\n.\n\n“[Antonio Liverano](https://liverano.com/)\n taught me that a suit is a suit, and a jacket is a jacket,” Jake remarks. “A suit is something you can wear as a complete look. It’s made from a four-season cloth and comes in blue or grey. A jacket, on the other hand, is where the fun begins. So while I like four-season blazers, I also enjoy summer sport coats in materials such as open-weave linens and winter sport coats in tweed.” This coming fall/ winter, he’s looking forward to getting back into woolen flannel.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff7d3073203292b4569cf9ec38ef7382/de4f726ac6a16bc6-6f/s540x810/0d25c891d111d30f5bcac1f71e6d6c44b2baab1a.jpg)\n\nI ask Jake if he has any suggestions for how younger men can get into tailored clothing. He’s thirty now and has twelve years of experience in the clothing trade, but — perhaps unsurprisingly — his advice is somewhat basic. Over the years, I’ve found that stylish people aren’t very exacting in their recommendations (when it comes to how he wears double-breasteds, a style many find intimidating, Jakes shrugs and says he just puts them on). Men who are simply well-dressed are all too happy to dictate things in millimetric proportions: the width of leg openings and size of cuffs. But stylish men often see things as being freeform. If you try to be too exacting, you strangle out style’s more essential characteristics. Still, we came up with a few things, even if they’re often-repeated truisms.\n\n**Buy Less, Buy Better**\n\n“We’re lucky; this isn’t the 1980s. We’re at a time when most men don’t have to wear a suit every day. So instead of having ten suits in a wardrobe, you can buy a few key pieces that will elevate how you look. That means you can also spend more on each one.”\n\n**Updating the Classics**\n\n“At Anglo Italian, we don’t do gimmicks. We don’t do Ghurka trousers or super-wide waistbands with multiple buttons. It’s just not our thing. We like the classics, but also feel that you can make them in a way so that they feel natural to you. One way to achieve that is with the cut. We like a high-rise trouser with pleats, but we don’t want them billowing or vintage looking. You don’t have to wear a fashion brand’s interpretation of a slim cut, but you can slim the leg up a little.\n\nSimilarly, we like jackets with softness and drape. The Italians call it \"bounce,” which means the chest isn’t glued to you; it has a bit of fullness. We also like an extended shoulder, but we want them to be soft and sloping, so they look relaxed. This way, the jacket feels soft and comfortable, but it has shape to it. It also looks natural to you.“\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5482ef003a566d0f643f1dfb7cf79002/de4f726ac6a16bc6-56/s540x810/ad751c8a629a43ef27957d2ceaa2ca06feee46d2.jpg)\n\n**Finding Your Silhouette**\n\n\"A lot of this is about knowing your proportions. I like a drapey chest, a broader shoulder, a lower buttoning point to get that bigger v-zone. I also like a relatively big lapel that breaks halfway across the chest. I have a shorter torso, so I like a higher rise, but the ideal cut will depend on the person. For years, we couldn’t find jeans that can be worn with sport coats, so we designed our own. We raised the rise and widened the thigh, but kept the taper. It’s about finding what works for you.”\n\n**Cold Colors, Matte Textures**\n\n“We don’t like ruddy browns or purple-y reds. We like colder colors that are easier to wear — steel blue, cold gray, and neutral olive. Fabrics are always matte and often textured. The secret is in how you combine those things: the cut, design, colors, and textures. That’s how you can update the look.”\n\n**Dressing Down**\n\n“I feel it’s easy to wear tailored clothing here in London. But I also appreciate that not everyone has that kind of environment. If people aren’t wearing suits in your town, there’s still room for a navy sport coat. You don’t need all the bells and whistles. You don’t have to go to the pub in Belgian loafers and a big windowpane jacket. The nuance is all in the cut and fabrics. A polo shirt or OCBD can soften a look. Wear patch pockets; use a lot of knitwear; throw jeans into a look. Try a polo shirt with jeans, sneakers, and a navy sport coat. There’s a way to do that look well.”\n\n**Style is More Than Clothes**\n\n“The great thing about tailored clothing is that it serves a social function. People wear tailored clothing to work, parties, and formal events. It allows people to do things, and doing things is really at the heart of style. Sometimes people think of tailoring as the stuff you buy and own, like stamp collecting. But real style is about going out and doing stuff; otherwise, you’re just dressing up. Doesn’t the Duke of Beaufort look better than a fashion model? It’s because he’s doing something in photos, not just staring blankly into a camera. Don’t let your clothes be the end-all, be-all.”\n\n_For more of [Anglo Italian](https://angloitalian.com/)\n, you can follow [Jake](https://www.instagram.com/jakeedwardgrantham/)\n, [Alex](https://www.instagram.com/alexpirounis/?hl=en)\n, and [the store on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/angloitaliancompany/?hl=en)\n. Naturally, almost everything they wear is available at Anglo Italian (many are designs that are exclusive to the shop, including the sport coats, jeans, and oxford button-downs).

1968, Tommy Nutter was exasperated with his sales job at Donaldson, Williamson, and G. Ward, a bespoke tailoring firm based in London’s Burlington Arcade. Nutter derisively described their house style as “little” and wanted to update it with some flair. The traditional-minded tailors in the workroom, however, dismissed his ideas as technically impossible and, in any case, tasteless. “People did not come here to be measured up for tents,” one journalist documented. So Tommy petitioned for a new job at [Henry Poole](https://henrypoole.com/)\n. When the firm’s managing director, Samuel Cundey, saw Tommy’s fashionably long hair, however, he sent him away, horrified.\n\nTommy would save his ideas for himself. Shortly after quitting his job, he and [Edward Sexton](https://www.edwardsexton.co.uk/)\n went on to form one of the most important tailoring houses of the 20th century, Nutters of Savile Row. If you believe menswear lore, many of the long-standing firms, such as [Huntsman](https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/)\n, viewed Nutters at first with suspicion. Bespoke tailoring at the time was a hush-hush and stuffy business. Tailoring shops didn’t even have display windows and firms such as [Anderson & Sheppard](https://www.anderson-sheppard.co.uk/)\n considered publicity vulgar. The expression “it’s not done” not only sums up the hard-edged attitude of many in the solvent class, but also the tailors who served them.\n\nNutters not only displayed their goods to the public, they also talked to journalists and attracted younger customers into the then-stodgy precincts of Savile Row. They tailored for Elton John, Mick Jagger, and The Beatles, as well as women such as Twiggy and Diana Ross. Men walked out of the Nutters shop clad in box plaid suits, flared pants, and mini-platform shoes. As they strutted down the street, competing tailors stared, mouths agape. Perhaps they were offended by the garish designs. Or maybe they feared Nutters made them look stodgy by comparison.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0342faa1ae5dc4526c5cac69694a6d17/de4f726ac6a16bc6-fb/s540x810/cb35852c558c84080f63e899eec69b6708bc4092.jpg)\n\nAngus Cundey, Samuel’s son, remembers things differently. In an issue of _Men’s Wear,_ he’s quoted as saying: “I would like to see this stuffy image removed from the West End, but in doing so we should not forsake our reputation for quality. I want to show that Savile Row keeps up with the times.” Just three months after Nutters opened, the Cundey family threw a proverbial “brick through their own obscured frontage” and installed a shop window to attract passers-by. Lance Richardson offers an excellent account of Nutter’s history in his book, _[House of Nutters](https://www.amazon.com/House-Nutter-Rebel-Tailor-Savile/dp/0451496469)\n_.  \n\n> Indeed, the Row turned out to be mostly on Tommy’s side. Any skepticism he did experience came predominately from outside — from the media, for instance, which was still pushing (and would continue to push, for decades to come) the idea of the industry in irreversible decline. \\[…\\] Tommy didn’t quite fit into this reductive narrative, so he was condescendingly dismissed, just one of the new “clothes artists” whose shops stood out mostly as “bright parodies of the old style — a sort of Space-Age Regency,” as though the future had no business mingling with a consecrated past.\n\nSince Nutters, tailoring has been reinvented a hundred times over. But at each of these iterations — Armani’s zoot-suit silhouette, Versace’s flashy riposte to Armani’s usual restraint, and Helmut Lang’s austere high-fashion tailoring — the clothes eventually look absurd once the fog of fashion lifts. Consequently, many men have retreated to classic tailoring for fear of looking bad in hindsight.\n\nI think there’s a middle road. There’s nothing wrong with referencing 1930s _Apparel Arts_ catalogs and the heydays of Ivy Style for inspiration. But if you’re looking for a modern take on classic tailoring, stores such as [The Armoury](https://thearmoury.com/)\n, [Drake’s](https://www.drakes.com/)\n, and [BRIO](https://www.instagram.com/briobeijing/)\n are doing a great job of balancing the two poles. These names won’t sound new to anyone who’s been reading men’s style blogs for a while now. But it’s worth noting that their Italian inspired cuts are rooted in tradition while also looking, well, cool and sexy. [Brooks Brothers](https://rstyle.me/+6JgU3jUg7HhAQ2YFeRD8WQ)\n is many things, but it is neither cool nor sexy.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b4326d56ddd4c84ef57fcc4b8c465d7/de4f726ac6a16bc6-42/s540x810/3f2fcbcc081f1da050515c5fa4eb334b70061fb3.jpg)\n\n[Anglo Italian](https://angloitalian.com)\n, a relatively new shop located in London’s Marylebone, is one of those places that’s helping bring a new generation of people into classic tailoring. One of the shop’s co-founders, Jake Grantham, has become a minor internet celebrity, although he’s somewhat media-shy. He doesn’t give many interviews and generally shuns promotion. But he and his business partner Alex Pirounis have a sizable following on Instagram because thousands of young men look to them for style inspiration.\n\n“With classic tailoring, there’s a real risk of looking pastiche,” says Jake. “As a younger guy in my 30s, I need to be able to wear clothes to parties and the pub. I have to be able to do things that guys at my age do. I feel strongly that I shouldn’t walk out of the shop looking like I’ve stepped out of the past. I realize it’s a fine line, but at Anglo Italian, we try to balance classic style with relevance.”\n\nJake has been wearing tailored clothing for much of his life. As a student at King’s College in Wimbledon, he was required to wear a suit at age 16 as part of the school’s uniform. Jake was eager about it, not least because he was also into old gangster films at the time, such as _[White Heat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w3n_eRizgw)\n_ and _[Little Ceaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeGMaVvzUVo)\n_, where the characters all wore dark worsteds with revers. “When you’re 16, you’re looking to give off a certain kind of masculinity, maybe because you’re coming of age and don’t have that sensibility yet. So appearance can be very important to you,” he said.\n\nWith a love for tailoring, Jake decided to pursue a career in the trade at age 18. Initially, he did some odd jobs for various bespoke tailoring shops, cleaning up stockrooms and delivering bunches to coat makers. Two years later, he became a sales associate at the then newly opened Drake’s flagship in London. This was around the time Michael Drake, the firm’s founder, was handing the company’s reins over to Michael Hill, now co-owner and Creative Director. When he graduated college, Mark Cho asked if he’d like to move to Hong Kong to work at The Armoury.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/774a322ebde272d8c6a1874f1729b55f/de4f726ac6a16bc6-fe/s540x810/165687d15f3c6420425bc0315036298a9b736551.jpg)\n\n“Those years were incredible,” Jake says fondly of his former employers. “Michael Drake was a huge influence on me. He was one of the first guys I saw wearing Italian sport coats with American button-downs and English flannel trousers. But he looked so much better than everyone else because his style was softer and more muted. I then spent five years at The Armoury at a time when the company was growing at a real pace, so there was a lot of opportunities. I was able to do a lot of the buying, development, and designing. I was able to go to Milano Unica, a tradeshow for cloth, which is where tailoring begins. If Drake’s was the beginning of my career in this trade, The Armoury allowed me to grow and put some ideas together.”\n\nJake says his style hasn’t changed that much since he was a teen, he’s just honed it. He grew up wearing waxed cotton [Barbour jackets](https://bit.ly/2Pd9r25)\n, [oxford button-downs](https://angloitalian.com/products/ocbd-shirt-ice-blue-oxford)\n, and [boat shoes](https://rstyle.me/+bhsr4WAMwBn8IJenomKZmQ)\n, which he still stands by today. “Maybe things have gotten a little more drapey, but only because I’ve put on weight,” Jake jokes. He says he’s most comfortable in a [navy hopsack sport coat](https://angloitalian.com/products/sport-jacket-wool-house-hopsack-navy)\n, [some grey Fresco trousers](https://angloitalian.com/products/tailored-trouser-twisted-wool-grey)\n, [a button-down oxford shirt](https://angloitalian.com/products/ocbd-shirt-ice-blue-oxford)\n, and [a pair of suede loafers](https://angloitalian.com/products/crockett-jones-bradbourne-loafer-brown-suede)\n. From fall until spring, Jake often wears raglan-sleeve coats, such as Barbour’s field jackets. He also likes five-pocket jeans and prefers button-up shirts in light blue (“they hide dirt better,” he noted, [“especially in reverse stripes”](https://angloitalian.com/products/ocbd-shirt-reverse-stripe-blue-oxford)\n). For casual shoes, he stomps around on weekends in [New Balance sneakers](https://rstyle.me/+H9ihmMgvPktOCkajoyieHw)\n and [Loro Piana’s Open Walks](https://rstyle.me/+wpSANmpatAjuyB7PbosRcA)\n.\n\n“[Antonio Liverano](https://liverano.com/)\n taught me that a suit is a suit, and a jacket is a jacket,” Jake remarks. “A suit is something you can wear as a complete look. It’s made from a four-season cloth and comes in blue or grey. A jacket, on the other hand, is where the fun begins. So while I like four-season blazers, I also enjoy summer sport coats in materials such as open-weave linens and winter sport coats in tweed.” This coming fall/ winter, he’s looking forward to getting back into woolen flannel.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff7d3073203292b4569cf9ec38ef7382/de4f726ac6a16bc6-6f/s540x810/0d25c891d111d30f5bcac1f71e6d6c44b2baab1a.jpg)\n\nI ask Jake if he has any suggestions for how younger men can get into tailored clothing. He’s thirty now and has twelve years of experience in the clothing trade, but — perhaps unsurprisingly — his advice is somewhat basic. Over the years, I’ve found that stylish people aren’t very exacting in their recommendations (when it comes to how he wears double-breasteds, a style many find intimidating, Jakes shrugs and says he just puts them on). Men who are simply well-dressed are all too happy to dictate things in millimetric proportions: the width of leg openings and size of cuffs. But stylish men often see things as being freeform. If you try to be too exacting, you strangle out style’s more essential characteristics. Still, we came up with a few things, even if they’re often-repeated truisms.\n\n**Buy Less, Buy Better**\n\n“We’re lucky; this isn’t the 1980s. We’re at a time when most men don’t have to wear a suit every day. So instead of having ten suits in a wardrobe, you can buy a few key pieces that will elevate how you look. That means you can also spend more on each one.”\n\n**Updating the Classics**\n\n“At Anglo Italian, we don’t do gimmicks. We don’t do Ghurka trousers or super-wide waistbands with multiple buttons. It’s just not our thing. We like the classics, but also feel that you can make them in a way so that they feel natural to you. One way to achieve that is with the cut. We like a high-rise trouser with pleats, but we don’t want them billowing or vintage looking. You don’t have to wear a fashion brand’s interpretation of a slim cut, but you can slim the leg up a little.\n\nSimilarly, we like jackets with softness and drape. The Italians call it \"bounce,” which means the chest isn’t glued to you; it has a bit of fullness. We also like an extended shoulder, but we want them to be soft and sloping, so they look relaxed. This way, the jacket feels soft and comfortable, but it has shape to it. It also looks natural to you.“\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5482ef003a566d0f643f1dfb7cf79002/de4f726ac6a16bc6-56/s540x810/ad751c8a629a43ef27957d2ceaa2ca06feee46d2.jpg)\n\n**Finding Your Silhouette**\n\n\"A lot of this is about knowing your proportions. I like a drapey chest, a broader shoulder, a lower buttoning point to get that bigger v-zone. I also like a relatively big lapel that breaks halfway across the chest. I have a shorter torso, so I like a higher rise, but the ideal cut will depend on the person. For years, we couldn’t find jeans that can be worn with sport coats, so we designed our own. We raised the rise and widened the thigh, but kept the taper. It’s about finding what works for you.”\n\n**Cold Colors, Matte Textures**\n\n“We don’t like ruddy browns or purple-y reds. We like colder colors that are easier to wear — steel blue, cold gray, and neutral olive. Fabrics are always matte and often textured. The secret is in how you combine those things: the cut, design, colors, and textures. That’s how you can update the look.”\n\n**Dressing Down**\n\n“I feel it’s easy to wear tailored clothing here in London. But I also appreciate that not everyone has that kind of environment. If people aren’t wearing suits in your town, there’s still room for a navy sport coat. You don’t need all the bells and whistles. You don’t have to go to the pub in Belgian loafers and a big windowpane jacket. The nuance is all in the cut and fabrics. A polo shirt or OCBD can soften a look. Wear patch pockets; use a lot of knitwear; throw jeans into a look. Try a polo shirt with jeans, sneakers, and a navy sport coat. There’s a way to do that look well.”\n\n**Style is More Than Clothes**\n\n“The great thing about tailored clothing is that it serves a social function. People wear tailored clothing to work, parties, and formal events. It allows people to do things, and doing things is really at the heart of style. Sometimes people think of tailoring as the stuff you buy and own, like stamp collecting. But real style is about going out and doing stuff; otherwise, you’re just dressing up. Doesn’t the Duke of Beaufort look better than a fashion model? It’s because he’s doing something in photos, not just staring blankly into a camera. Don’t let your clothes be the end-all, be-all.”\n\n_For more of [Anglo Italian](https://angloitalian.com/)\n, you can follow [Jake](https://www.instagram.com/jakeedwardgrantham/)\n, [Alex](https://www.instagram.com/alexpirounis/?hl=en)\n, and [the store on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/angloitaliancompany/?hl=en)\n. Naturally, almost everything they wear is available at Anglo Italian (many are designs that are exclusive to the shop, including the sport coats, jeans, and oxford button-downs).

Tommy Nutter was exasperated with his sales job at Donaldson, Williamson, and G. Ward, a bespoke tailoring firm based in London’s Burlington Arcade. Nutter derisively described their house style as “little” and wanted to update it with some flair. The traditional-minded tailors in the workroom, however, dismissed his ideas as technically impossible and, [...]Read More...","ogUrl":"http://oxs.335.myftpupload.com/2019/09/04/tailoring-for-younger-men/","ogImage":"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5f9b11b38688017f13cdd392c04f1347/de4f726ac6a16bc6-cb/s540x810/77037799cbbc9f3dc59cc313cddc35df6e485df9.jpg","ogLocale":"en_US","ogLocaleAlternate":[],"ogSiteName":"Die, Workwear!","modifiedTime":"2020-05-12T05:54:46+00:00","publishedTime":"2019-09-04T19:45:19+00:00","sourceURL":"https://dieworkwear.com/2019/09/04/tailoring-for-younger-men/"}},{"content":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0d62ad76dedba9e484e6de910c4e618/448aee7a48352003-6c/s540x810/4c33ca89370ce658c2448d1b3053a2aed2a7ab53.jpg)\n\nA friendly reminder: the order window for this year’s summer tweed re-run closes this Friday, August 30th. Since introducing it in 2016, I’ve been happily surprised to see it pop up in some unexpected places.

Bespoke shoemaker [Nicholas Templeman](http://www.nicholastempleman.com/)\n wore it in a _Last Magazine_ feature. [Dionisio D’Alise](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bww_VEgAhkz/)\n, the head cutter at [Sartoria Formosa](https://bit.ly/2H9qf3k)\n, sometimes wears it at fittings. [Anderson & Sheppard trained coatmaker Lee Oxley](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0EVlsupwYo/)\n says he loves the cloth. The best response, however – and I mean this genuinely – has come from readers, who email me to say how much they like their resulting suits and sport coats. \n\nI originally designed the fabric because I was looking for something like the silk jacketing you see on Taka from [Liverano & Liverano](https://liverano.com)\n above (the photo above is from [The Armoury](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1snEBxpoXH/)\n, my fabric is pictured below). There was once a time when raw silk jacketing was a bit more commonly available. The material has the same slubby texture you see in raw silk ties, but it comes in a weight that’s suitable for tailoring. Today, however, it’s all but impossible to find outside of vintage fabric vaults. So I designed my own.\n\nThis is a mid-brown, 9/10 oz fabric made from a 60/ 40 blend of linen and silk. Despite having a bit of silk, the cloth is matte and breathable. It has a semi-open weave that’s suitable for the heat. It holds a crease and is hard-wearing. Most importantly, it has a bit of irregular texture and slight flecking, which makes it look like your favorite Donegal tweeds. It can be hard to find a good spring/ summer fabric once you get past your basic tropical wools and linens. Most are a bit too flat-looking, or too crisp to hold a pattern (on a clear-finished worsted, sometimes a pattern can look too vivid). This allows you to add a bit of a pattern to a summer outfit while still making it easy to wear.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3a0ff3535801ad1d19414dfe5a443402/448aee7a48352003-10/s540x810/80ba4854e445a1091e19047bcdb770195e8fa933.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/98de0b039cbb937c0348a8d2e2677156/448aee7a48352003-a6/s540x810/5ff1d3733b7e1d8a797482bf85109eedc05ccb4d.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9e5f8f44a61a796362dd1e84bd1b3e8/448aee7a48352003-e6/s540x810/35b52e2af350280a5138de21e834d833c1c4600a.jpg)\n\nLater this year, [Spier & Mackay](https://www.spierandmackay.com/)\n will also offer summer tweed suits and sport coats through their online custom tailoring program.

This was, of course, before surgeon cuffs were standard on ready-to-wear, but the passage will ring true to anyone who’s ever obsessed over the details. \n\n“Real buttonholes. That’s it!” Wolfe exclaimed. “A man can take his thumb and forefinger and unbutton his sleeve at the wrist because this kind of suit has real buttonholes there. \\[…\\] Yes! The lid was off, and poor old Ross was already hooked on the secret vice of the Big men in New York: custom tailoring and the mania for the marginal differences that go into it. Practically all the most powerful men in New York, especially on Wall Street, the people in investment houses, banks and law firms, the politicians, especially Brooklyn Democrats, for some reason, outstanding dandies, those fellows, the blue-chip culturati, the major museum directors and publishers, the kind who sit in offices with antique textile shades – practically all of these men are fanatical about the marginal differences that go into custom tailoring.”\n\nThe phrase “it’s all about the details” has been exhausted, but in classic men’s tailoring, it’s still true. Suits and sport coats follow a template that’s the result of many generations and skilled hands. But there’s still plenty of room for personal expression. Much has been written about pocket styles (jetted, welted, and patched), lapel shape (peak, notch, straight, and bellied), and closure (single button, two-button, three-roll-two, and the never to be worn hard-three). However, there’s not much online about how the edge of a coat can be finished. It’s a detail that’s easy to forget but can make a surprisingly strong impact on how a garment looks. Here’s a run-through:\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b17668d3acd27b6a8aa555702f2b30c7/a30a0627a2c529bb-8a/s540x810/6bff91fd0eb3c86ed3e3d67db7b39bacec8233c0.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4905b4a46a9f1a2f34132a91fe3aac72/a30a0627a2c529bb-db/s540x810/7b60bc423a9efdd95ba16e4f9f4c4e735342eee8.jpg)\n\n**SINGLE EDGE STITCHING**\n\nLet’s start with some basics. Since the edge of cut cloth frays, a tailor has to sew a seam away from the edge (this is known as a seam allowance). Once sewn, the fabric is then folded over, like the flapping wings on a bird. Doing so conceals the seam between the two layers, allowing the garment to look more cleanly finished. You can see this in the photo of the double-faced, charcoal cloth above.\n\nAfter the fabric has been turned over, the edge is pressed. However, this edge can be distorted over time if exposed to humidity ([a good reason to never use garment steamers](https://putthison.com/beware-of-steamers-a-garment-steamer-like-the-one/)\n or hang a suit up in a steamy bathroom). So, to prevent these layers from puffing up, a tailor will sew the outside by hand, compressing the four layers using either a backstitch or running stitch. In factories, this same effect is sometimes imitated using AMF, Complett, or Columbia machines. If the stitch is done with a lockstitch machine (the same type of device used to make the internal seam), then it is known as a single stitch. The photos above are from Jeffery Diduch, who has more info on this on his excellent tailoring blog, [Tutto Fatto a Mano](http://tuttofattoamano.blogspot.com/search/label/pickstitching)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0bcad9a80d1d72d1303ef198f15f562d/a30a0627a2c529bb-2c/s540x810/f86809bc4829c6a9be993b0d07f1a81e9ad5404c.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6717ff675575a3d2c4422e35744bdc28/a30a0627a2c529bb-f2/s540x810/090ffc65c60cc790cf5f0a4f1063c5edfe4fabd3.jpg)\n\nThis edge stitching can be seen above in the Armoury’s photos ([shot by Milad Abedi at the last Pitti Uomo](https://thearmoury.com/pages/portaits-at-pitti-with-milad-abedi-96)\n). It’s the most common finishing style on tailored clothing, and probably makes up the bulk of garments in your closet. This stitching keeps the edge laying flat and crisp, as well as preventing it from rolling to the wrong side. And since it’s done close to the edge — about 1/16\" away — it’s discreet and subtle. For the most part, the seam disappears and becomes part of the edge’s line.\n\nOn a handmade suit, particularly fine worsteds, hand picked edge stitching can result in a lovely, artisanal detail: a slight dimpling, which you can see on Taka’s grey suit above. On machine-made garments, however, sometimes this effect is exaggerated and looks … less great. When shopping, be wary of pick stitching that looks like it was executed with a nail gun. Well-executed machine stitching looks better than faux handwork. There’s no shame in good machine-sewing either. Most traditional American suits and sport coats, including those from [J. Press](https://jpressonline.com/)\n, are finished with a lockstitch.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/03888496d7a42add12d5a4ef0b3ee14e/a30a0627a2c529bb-d1/s540x810/a520247f2001c67e92183df2cfd075b8d8a9c2aa.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a7878100a70a1caf2fb61ed1dfdd8b57/a30a0627a2c529bb-e8/s540x810/9c2ef388011ff4ea06ed22035d164c7f78ace30b.jpg)\n\n**DOUBLE EDGE STITCHING**\n\nA double edge stitch is simply two rows of edge stitching. The style is more common in Southern Italy, especially Naples. And while the practical effect is the same –  to compress the four layers of fabric so the edge lays flat – the second row is mostly done for bragging rights. It’s a way to make a garment with a higher level of handwork. In Italy, tailors often use a thicker thread, such as silk buttonhole twist, to make the detail look exuberant. I think of it as being a showy, regional detail, like waterfall sleeve heads or overlapping cuff buttons. I also think it’s better on summer garments, such as Simon and Pino’s tan sport coats above, although that’s not a hard rule. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2e8ec1489ed2d6598cc19621e489144e/a30a0627a2c529bb-1d/s540x810/889f8c5b39566c0aae9dd636b9aecf1912d98063.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4818034c8946c01a52996eb654eaef32/a30a0627a2c529bb-3e/s540x810/5d6b7304464fd5264487d2cd7ccb5c79a9994285.jpg)\n\n**SWELLED EDGE**\n\nFinally, we have a swelled edge. Edge stitching is typically done 1/16\" away from the edge to keep it discrete. But if you move the stitching a little more inward, towards the end of the seam allowance, it creates what’s known as a swelled edge. Instead of compressing all four layers of fabric, a shifted seam will only hold down two. This encases the two internal layers, puffs them up, and creates a sort of bas-relief effect. Think of how the stitching on a quilted jacket puffs up the batting inside.\n\nWhen done by a lockstitch machine (a single stitch), the added number of stitches per inch will create a tighter seam, and thus a more pronounced look. You can see this on Mark Cho’s fall cotton suit above. Traditionally, American clothiers — including [Brooks Brothers](https://www.brooksbrothers.com/)\n and [J. Press](https://jpressonline.com/)\n — finished some of their fall and winter garments this way. [The Armoury’s washed cotton suit this fall](https://thearmoury.com/products/the-armoury-washed-cotton-model-11a-suit)\n has many of those American trad hallmarks: a 3-roll-2 button stance, slightly narrower lapel, and a single stitched, swelled edge\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f1aa077d4250ebfd9729d3323df3b4ff/a30a0627a2c529bb-12/s540x810/bf5997b705dee1f1ea99214e0fca2787e918634e.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a23b1a23e0152c070289b6c7c117d878/a30a0627a2c529bb-5a/s540x810/1562541a304e5ab95df059d4d2f10db5b4aab48f.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9f9fe83366a41796afd518915aaf156/a30a0627a2c529bb-73/s540x810/2fdf18c9e307eb5c8d140d1bf3a87bff18bcfbe0.jpg)\n\nMuch like how edge stitching can be done by hand (pick stitched) or machine (lockstitch), the same is true of a swelled edge. If a swelled edge is hand-sewn, the effect is a little more subtle. [Steed](https://steed.co.uk/)\n in London finished [Voxsartoria’s](https://www.voxsartoria.com)\n Donegal sport coat above with a hand picked, swelled edge. On fabrics that are either very lightweight or spongey, this effect can be harder to spot. I find it’s more apparent with substantial, denser goods, such as hearty tweeds that weigh more than 14oz.\n\nIn the photos above, you can see the difference a machine can make. The handsewn swelled seam on the lighter gray flannel is less pronounced, whereas the darker grey flannel (machine-sewn) is more tightly bound and readily apparent. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c993c8d86b0075da8e7ea6b53bab5745/a30a0627a2c529bb-89/s540x810/bfccbfc8ba961f7544627c63b4a579bbd805dd05.jpg)\n\n**SO, WHEN TO USE WHAT?**\n\nOn ready-to-wear and most made-to-measure, these decisions will be made for you. Depending on the garment’s cloth and design, a manufacturer will use the type of edge finishing they feel looks the most coherent. But if you have a chance to choose something for yourself, here are some rules of thumb I follow:\n\n*   On formal suits, always get a single row of edge stitching. It’s clean, elegant, and goes with the formality of your outfit.\n*   On more casual garments, particularly those with a Southern Italian style, consider a double row of hand picked stitching. This detail works better on solid-colored fabrics. On a patterned garment, the stitching can either disappear or make the garment look too busy. Think about the cloth.\n*   On other casual garments, particularly those made for fall and winter, get a swelled edge. Tweed and corduroy sport coats don’t look right to me without one. The sportier detail helps make a garment look more casual, and goes well with the naturally rustic sensibility of autumn clothing.\n*   Generally speaking, if your coat has patch pockets, the edges should probably be finished with some kind of casual edge, either double picked or swelled.\n\nThat said, a lot of this is up to taste. Steed emailed me yesterday to ask how I want my current order to be finished. It’s a brown summer jacket made from a slubby, wool-silk-linen cloth (pictured below). I went with a swelled edge, mostly because a single row of edge stitching felt too clean to me, while asking for double pick stitching from an English tailor seemed wrong. Go with your gut.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0e9c171826e31aaf4f8430cecd0cab9/a30a0627a2c529bb-9d/s540x810/fc6f527004b8d50fc00c33afe7359f0f18bdf359.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cd6bdc113efe710a73cc25b6171964a1/a30a0627a2c529bb-99/s540x810/5e462c71d0c8807404bdcd2f9c1d3e521f4d0ed3.jpg)\n\nIn his 1966 essay “The Secret Vice,” originally published in _The New York Herald Tribune_, the white-clad chronicler of American culture, Tom Wolfe, starts by talking about men who love handmade buttonholes. This was, of course, before surgeon cuffs were standard on ready-to-wear, but the passage will ring true to anyone who’s ever obsessed over the details. \n\n“Real buttonholes. That’s it!” Wolfe exclaimed. “A man can take his thumb and forefinger and unbutton his sleeve at the wrist because this kind of suit has real buttonholes there. \\[…\\] Yes! The lid was off, and poor old Ross was already hooked on the secret vice of the Big men in New York: custom tailoring and the mania for the marginal differences that go into it. Practically all the most powerful men in New York, especially on Wall Street, the people in investment houses, banks and law firms, the politicians, especially Brooklyn Democrats, for some reason, outstanding dandies, those fellows, the blue-chip culturati, the major museum directors and publishers, the kind who sit in offices with antique textile shades – practically all of these men are fanatical about the marginal differences that go into custom tailoring.”\n\nThe phrase “it’s all about the details” has been exhausted, but in classic men’s tailoring, it’s still true. Suits and sport coats follow a template that’s the result of many generations and skilled hands. But there’s still plenty of room for personal expression. Much has been written about pocket styles (jetted, welted, and patched), lapel shape (peak, notch, straight, and bellied), and closure (single button, two-button, three-roll-two, and the never to be worn hard-three). However, there’s not much online about how the edge of a coat can be finished. It’s a detail that’s easy to forget but can make a surprisingly strong impact on how a garment looks. Here’s a run-through:\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b17668d3acd27b6a8aa555702f2b30c7/a30a0627a2c529bb-8a/s540x810/6bff91fd0eb3c86ed3e3d67db7b39bacec8233c0.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4905b4a46a9f1a2f34132a91fe3aac72/a30a0627a2c529bb-db/s540x810/7b60bc423a9efdd95ba16e4f9f4c4e735342eee8.jpg)\n\n**SINGLE EDGE STITCHING**\n\nLet’s start with some basics. Since the edge of cut cloth frays, a tailor has to sew a seam away from the edge (this is known as a seam allowance). Once sewn, the fabric is then folded over, like the flapping wings on a bird. Doing so conceals the seam between the two layers, allowing the garment to look more cleanly finished. You can see this in the photo of the double-faced, charcoal cloth above.\n\nAfter the fabric has been turned over, the edge is pressed. However, this edge can be distorted over time if exposed to humidity ([a good reason to never use garment steamers](https://putthison.com/beware-of-steamers-a-garment-steamer-like-the-one/)\n or hang a suit up in a steamy bathroom). So, to prevent these layers from puffing up, a tailor will sew the outside by hand, compressing the four layers using either a backstitch or running stitch. In factories, this same effect is sometimes imitated using AMF, Complett, or Columbia machines. If the stitch is done with a lockstitch machine (the same type of device used to make the internal seam), then it is known as a single stitch.

But at last month’s Pitti Uomo, there was a strange and unexpected booth. It was nearly all white, had angular shelves, and showcased a new line of ready-to-wear shoes. Above the display, a printed banner read, “Foster & Son.”\n\nFor the last hundred years, London’s bespoke tailoring and shoemaking trades have prided themselves on being different from ready-to-wear. Many companies took great pains to explain how custom-clothing is superior to factory production. Additionally, the Savile Row Bespoke Association tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to guard who can use the term bespoke. But in the last ten years, there’s been a shift. Many of London’s best bespoke firms are now using the craft side of their business to give their ready-to-wear lines a halo — something Parisian _haute couture_ houses have been doing for decades.\n\nThe venerable firm [Foster & Sons](https://foster.co.uk/)\n has carried the grand tradition of bespoke shoemaking since 1840. They’re part of a small group of custom shoemakers located on the West End, sitting alongside names such as [John Lobb](https://www.johnlobbltd.co.uk/)\n and [George Cleverley](https://www.georgecleverley.com/)\n. During England’s medieval period, London was split into two halves. There was the proper city of London on the east, which was a center for finance, banking, and law. Then the City of Westminster on the west. When King Henry VIII built his new royal palace on St. James in the 16th century, he brought with him his aristocratic following. Wealthy elites were happy to live west of London because the pleasurable countryside was usually upwind of the smoke drifting from the crowded City. Over time, as money poured into the area, the West End became known for all the things associated with British aristocratic life — shopping, leisure, gentlemen’s clubs, government, and bespoke shoemaking.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4f33fea7fc2ee87767a2b307604445f/35753b8430f5e424-82/s540x810/b3e87f7303fa2327eb97a7e7b4a788f8f37ba338.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a2f559e69df1eb6d4e6b4a9550cda8a/35753b8430f5e424-ef/s540x810/afa082e170ebbabbb9f87c4b0a20c23675656eb2.jpg)\n\nAmong the West End shoemakers, Foster & Son is best known for being the most direct successor to Peal, once the largest and most well-known bespoke shoemaking firms. Peal was a pioneer in the “traveling bespoke” business model. By the mid-20th century, they built a clientele list that stretched throughout North and South America, Europe, and East Asia. Sales reps traveled abroad to meet with men, measure and trace their feet, and then take their orders. These notes were then posted to Peal’s factory back in Acton Vale, London, and the polished shoes were delivered six weeks later. This “traveling bespoke” system was so successful that, by the time of the company’s closing, two-thirds of Peal’s production went for export.\n\nTheir client list was impressive. There was the regular run of Hollywood stars (Fred Astaire, Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks, Henry Fonda, Steve McQueen, etc.); industrialists such as Henry Ford; intellectuals such as Hugh Trevor-Roper; politicians such as John F. Kennedy; and almost every diplomat, aristocrat, and king from that period. It’s hard to imagine this many people ordering bespoke shoes from just one firm today. Peal was also an important innovator. They developed a system whereby a handmade last could be duplicated up to eight times on a copying lathe. An important innovation, I imagine, given the massive demand.\n\nUnfortunately, by the mid-20th century, the company struggled to find suitable replacements for their skilled craftsmen. This led to longer delivery times and, sadly, eventually the closing of the factory in 1965. The trading name was then sold to [Brooks Brothers](https://rstyle.me/+6JgU3jUg7HhAQ2YFeRD8WQ)\n. You can see the letter sealing this agreement above.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f41b248fe6efc9f2674a6bd1313c134/35753b8430f5e424-25/s540x810/64a7b0e667638431984cd2fcd755746b3b02439a.jpg)\n\nBrooks Brothers still trades its shoes under the Peal & Co. banner, but of course, all this history has been forgotten. Their shoes today are made by various English and Italian firms. Peal still somewhat lives on through Foster & Son, however. When the Peal closed, their bespoke last maker, Terry Moore, took many of their lasts with him to Foster & Son, where they’re used today as a valuable reference point. This history is why you can still see Peal’s “boot and fox” emblem in Foster & Son’s signage. It’s the same boot and fox, you’ll notice, that Brooks Brothers stamps inside of their footwear.\n\nIn his 1959 book _[Nothing but the Best](https://rstyle.me/+rLM1XDObitHunsG7Ai-MkA)\n_, Thomas Girtin describes a lively London labor market that’s full of skilled craftsmen. Sixty years later, the scenes in that book have almost all but disappeared. Today, many bespoke tailoring houses and shoemaking firms struggle to find head cutters and last makers. Whereas there used to be enough tailors on Savile Row to fill the surrounding pubs after working hours, today the trade is much smaller and lonelier. Meanwhile, the cost of labor and rent is going up.\n\nSimon Cundy, who co-owns one of Savile Row’s original tailoring houses, [Henry Poole](https://henrypoole.com/hp/)\n, says skyrocketing rents are squeezing many bespoke firms. “Companies you think would be doing fine, behind the scenes they’re not so fine,” he says. “When our lease came up, we were initially asked to pay 70% higher in rent, but we talked the landlord down. It was a tough moment and adjustments had to be made.” In the last five years, some Savile Row firms have seen their rents double or triple, going well past what’s charged on Bond Street. Henry Poole, founded in 1806, holds 48 royal warrants and has tailored for the likes of Winston Churchill and Napoleon. If not protected, some of Savile Row’s centuries-old firms could be snuffed out, which would leave the Golden Mile with the same fashion brands you can find in any country.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dfd2c9a002b6af4e35f20123cb8f26ff/35753b8430f5e424-b3/s540x810/2123ad027bb8fe0951f837c9b9ceedb25fbf0d3a.png)\n\nThe West End hasn’t been any better. Eight years ago, rents in this part of London hovered around £100 per sq ft. But when business rates were reformed in 2017, some firms saw a rent increase of over 130 percent, according to the regional business association [The New West End Company](https://www.newwestend.com/)\n. At these rates, it’s no wonder why so many of London’s leading tailoring and shoemaking firms are moving into ready-to-wear. Handmade items are not scalable — they’re labor-intensive, require rare skill sets, and are sold on a one-off basis. If you want to double your profits, you have to double your production, which means increasing your workforce or labor hours. Ready-to-wear production, on the other hand, can be made much more cheaply and quickly, and then sold around the world with a bit of marketing.\n\nThere’s some irony in the fact that so many bespoke firms have had to move into ready-to-wear just so they can keep an address on Savile Row or in the West End, which is essential in today’s age of “authenticity.” Today, you can find off-the-rack clothing from almost all of the leading Savile Row tailoring firms, including [Huntsman](https://therake.com/brands/huntsman.html)\n, [Anderson & Sheppard](https://rstyle.me/+n8sq65xg6h8QIvzV1CHA7Q)\n, and [Gieves & Hawkes](https://therake.com/brands/gieves-hawkes.html)\n. Mr. Porter also has no fewer than 45 pairs of ready-to-wear shoes from [George Cleverly](https://rstyle.me/+UOCzCwmNWcMhze_10ncAkg)\n, more than the entire line up of many high-end brands.\n\nFoster & Sons’ new line, however, is unique. While the company has been offering ready-to-wear shoes since the 1970s, in addition to their bespoke service, they recently acquired their own Northampton factory. This new factory gives them total control over their own production (in the past, [Crockett & Jones](https://rstyle.me/+AqQ-ChiuyzvoyFbDC_12oQ)\n manufactured Foster’s ready-to-wear line). Their new lasts were made in-house by their lastmaker, Simon Bolzoni, and then graded up and down for the different sizes. At the factory, there are also a couple of people who used to work at [Edward Green](https://rstyle.me/+yd8m-zJf0O6m8xIzh5jgrA)\n.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/63b1da682a08d5d02bb64929c24c1c13/35753b8430f5e424-9e/s540x810/e67a6b76d3181af389eceaa2c81d14a780288f9a.jpg)\n\nThis seems like a significant move for a traditional craft-based business. Running a bespoke shop is very different from running a ready-to-wear brand, and having your own factory means dealing with new costs. However, when I talked to Fosters’ retail manager Andrew Murphy, he seemed unconcerned. Foster, he says, is committed to making the best shoes in both bespoke and ready-to-wear. He anticipates that having control over the full production will allow them to offer a superior product, which he believes will be warmly received in discerning markets such as Japan. He also says the company has no plans for manufacturing for anyone but themselves, unlike other Northampton factories.\n\nThe good news is that, on paper, the shoes look excellent. They’re made from full-grain leathers, feature leather stiffeners (rather than the more common Celastic), and have carefully cut, beveled waists. The lasts are beautifully shaped with either an almond or a soft chiseled toe. The company also uses just the right pitch of mid-brown without any of the red undertones you sometimes see in other lines (those warmer hues can be harder to wear with the cooler greys and blues that dominate men’s wardrobes). [Their Burford loafer](https://foster.co.uk/product/burford-antique-brown-calf-18-last/)\n is the closest alternative I’ve seen to [Edward Green’s Picadilly](https://rstyle.me/+EQ3UGrB7aM1L-Woju4EQcw)\n, which for me is the Platonic ideal of a penny loafer. [The Keble is a Norwegian split-toe](https://foster.co.uk/product/keble-peat-calf-05-last/)\n with a handsewn, pie-crust apron and seamless back counter, the second being a detail typically only seen in bespoke. It also looks like a good alternative to [the iconic Dover](https://rstyle.me/+wfKlfvplbCTKyIKZ0zpdew)\n. \n\nPrices aren’t inexpensive, but starting around $775 for non-slippers, they’re also in a sweet spot. In the last few years, the entry-level end of the market has become intensely competitive with brands such as [Meermin](https://meermin.com/)\n, [Löf & Tung](https://www.skoaktiebolaget.com/collections/lof-tung)\n, and [Grant Stone](https://www.grantstoneshoes.com/)\n. Meanwhile, companies such as [Crockett & Jones](https://rstyle.me/+AqQ-ChiuyzvoyFbDC_12oQ)\n, [Vass](https://bit.ly/2K70nqU)\n, and [Enzo Bonafé](https://www.skoaktiebolaget.com/collections/enzo-bonafe)\n continue to dominate the tier above. Foster & Son’s new line is poised to compete in that mid-market, offering people a little bit of handwork for hand grade prices. If London’s bespoke firms have to move into ready-to-wear, at least we can happy the products are good. Who knows, with enough time, maybe we’ll see more bespoke names at Pitti Uomo. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd5a97f43b81ffc2672559a232f621d1/35753b8430f5e424-5b/s540x810/4e8e418bd205b5349809d53a1bf9bd82acb053af.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c07f543799311b9c3f2a971cecb3d2e6/35753b8430f5e424-c5/s540x810/ddae1c66a12cec888393c227797e705aeb0ef4d2.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/36df15ea85588a967d3cbf713192b7e2/35753b8430f5e424-b1/s540x810/2df7ea8952604ea612b10eec6cace1304ac99d27.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d4e94d171d399f09bff05aa074c1f496/35753b8430f5e424-b4/s540x810/4b023d0ec0fa2bc0dae4d3d01b5c4f15da8fb48c.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/204fcfbf54069118b9cb216111bb84f1/35753b8430f5e424-1d/s540x810/0cddf7149b0714f45e07c8bc44fd300d4019dc3d.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/140f8b12dda62ed43bf6491d63676f45/35753b8430f5e424-3f/s540x810/1b6ef0d2953820b0426fe738ec59cdb8713e4b42.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcdc05c42308d3462d039f444559d4/35753b8430f5e424-3c/s540x810/929fa087c724168fed4106945e746c57c39c5cdb.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/500c1a533371b2176034d9d5eb1aa333/35753b8430f5e424-07/s540x810/982f39191282b801f5f827dea78a9eabcef22f3e.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/632d26abea0b3964c56bbeb22053f821/35753b8430f5e424-28/s540x810/69fffd6389128d91beb2fbc89b6c7a79401c8b1e.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4af49b1c13381ac24673482d78989bd/35753b8430f5e424-1b/s540x810/07fdd7dd4774667cc3b5748bf8aa305fc941f20b.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/06e2436e1644d7a7705bd5111314c238/35753b8430f5e424-70/s540x810/3fffb52aed981137f9529b4b611a0f296c2ea300.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0fb1b5fb6028d18cdbd44f5fc9a700c2/35753b8430f5e424-8c/s540x810/1d56a1d25793f2f1de8102ab9afb16b4a38bb304.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d36444795868b2eb68f75356e04d2282/35753b8430f5e424-ae/s540x810/894b5b6d28ba7f63bf610b4bf0e8d486da0377ec.png)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9caa96f4927b17e8883b6348a218f79b/35753b8430f5e424-54/s540x810/6c40838b3497d87316ee114248638e0227a524d1.jpg)\n\nPitti Uomo is the twice-a-year menswear tradeshow in Florence, Italy, where industry buyers and sellers meet so they can coordinate their seasonal offerings. But at last month’s Pitti Uomo, there was a strange and unexpected booth. It was nearly all white, had angular shelves, and showcased a new line of ready-to-wear shoes. Above the display, a printed banner read, “Foster & Son.”\n\nFor the last hundred years, London’s bespoke tailoring and shoemaking trades have prided themselves on being different from ready-to-wear. Many companies took great pains to explain how custom-clothing is superior to factory production. Additionally, the Savile Row Bespoke Association tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to guard who can use the term bespoke. But in the last ten years, there’s been a shift. Many of London’s best bespoke firms are now using the craft side of their business to give their ready-to-wear lines a halo — something Parisian _haute couture_ houses have been doing for decades.\n\nThe venerable firm [Foster & Sons](https://foster.co.uk/)\n has carried the grand tradition of bespoke shoemaking since 1840. They’re part of a small group of custom shoemakers located on the West End, sitting alongside names such as [John Lobb](https://www.johnlobbltd.co.uk/)\n and [George Cleverley](https://www.georgecleverley.com/)\n. During England’s medieval period, London was split into two halves. There was the proper city of London on the east, which was a center for finance, banking, and law. Then the City of Westminster on the west. When King Henry VIII built his new royal palace on St. James in the 16th century, he brought with him his aristocratic following. Wealthy elites were happy to live west of London because the pleasurable countryside was usually upwind of the smoke drifting from the crowded City. Over time, as money poured into the area, the West End became known for all the things associated with British aristocratic life — shopping, leisure, gentlemen’s clubs, government, and bespoke shoemaking.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4f33fea7fc2ee87767a2b307604445f/35753b8430f5e424-82/s540x810/b3e87f7303fa2327eb97a7e7b4a788f8f37ba338.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a2f559e69df1eb6d4e6b4a9550cda8a/35753b8430f5e424-ef/s540x810/afa082e170ebbabbb9f87c4b0a20c23675656eb2.jpg)\n\nAmong the West End shoemakers, Foster & Son is best known for being the most direct successor to Peal, once the largest and most well-known bespoke shoemaking firms. Peal was a pioneer in the “traveling bespoke” business model. By the mid-20th century, they built a clientele list that stretched throughout North and South America, Europe, and East Asia. Sales reps traveled abroad to meet with men, measure and trace their feet, and then take their orders. These notes were then posted to Peal’s factory back in Acton Vale, London, and the polished shoes were delivered six weeks later. This “traveling bespoke” system was so successful that, by the time of the company’s closing, two-thirds of Peal’s production went for export.\n\nTheir client list was impressive. There was the regular run of Hollywood stars (Fred Astaire, Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks, Henry Fonda, Steve McQueen, etc.); industrialists such as Henry Ford; intellectuals such as Hugh Trevor-Roper; politicians such as John F.

Who knows, with enough time, maybe we’ll see more bespoke names at Pitti Uomo. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd5a97f43b81ffc2672559a232f621d1/35753b8430f5e424-5b/s540x810/4e8e418bd205b5349809d53a1bf9bd82acb053af.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c07f543799311b9c3f2a971cecb3d2e6/35753b8430f5e424-c5/s540x810/ddae1c66a12cec888393c227797e705aeb0ef4d2.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/36df15ea85588a967d3cbf713192b7e2/35753b8430f5e424-b1/s540x810/2df7ea8952604ea612b10eec6cace1304ac99d27.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d4e94d171d399f09bff05aa074c1f496/35753b8430f5e424-b4/s540x810/4b023d0ec0fa2bc0dae4d3d01b5c4f15da8fb48c.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/204fcfbf54069118b9cb216111bb84f1/35753b8430f5e424-1d/s540x810/0cddf7149b0714f45e07c8bc44fd300d4019dc3d.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/140f8b12dda62ed43bf6491d63676f45/35753b8430f5e424-3f/s540x810/1b6ef0d2953820b0426fe738ec59cdb8713e4b42.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcdc05c42308d3462d039f444559d4/35753b8430f5e424-3c/s540x810/929fa087c724168fed4106945e746c57c39c5cdb.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/500c1a533371b2176034d9d5eb1aa333/35753b8430f5e424-07/s540x810/982f39191282b801f5f827dea78a9eabcef22f3e.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/632d26abea0b3964c56bbeb22053f821/35753b8430f5e424-28/s540x810/69fffd6389128d91beb2fbc89b6c7a79401c8b1e.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4af49b1c13381ac24673482d78989bd/35753b8430f5e424-1b/s540x810/07fdd7dd4774667cc3b5748bf8aa305fc941f20b.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/06e2436e1644d7a7705bd5111314c238/35753b8430f5e424-70/s540x810/3fffb52aed981137f9529b4b611a0f296c2ea300.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0fb1b5fb6028d18cdbd44f5fc9a700c2/35753b8430f5e424-8c/s540x810/1d56a1d25793f2f1de8102ab9afb16b4a38bb304.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d36444795868b2eb68f75356e04d2282/35753b8430f5e424-ae/s540x810/894b5b6d28ba7f63bf610b4bf0e8d486da0377ec.png)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"How London's Bespoke is Changing — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"How London's Bespoke is Changing — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Pitti Uomo is the twice-a-year menswear tradeshow in Florence, Italy, where industry buyers and sellers meet so they can coordinate their seasonal offerings.

The article, titled [“Androgynous World,”](https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/19/archives/androgynous-world.html)\n is about the persistence of the androgynous ideal. The United States at this time was at a flashpoint. While gender stereotypes were becoming more rigid, fashionistas and feminists were imagining a freer future. About five years earlier, Pierre Cardin and Paco Rabanne conjured up streamlined “Space Age” jumpsuits made from stretchy, synthetic fabrics as a way to imagine a unisex world. Second-wave feminists were also pushing back against the gender stereotypes of the previous decade. Many feminists believed girls were being lured into their subservient roles by first accepting gendered clothing expectations. To be equal to men, they’d dress like them – or, at least, in ways that weren’t traditionally feminine.\n\n“The idea of androgyny apparently takes a little getting used to. First responses tend either toward bewilderment or hostility. The word itself is easily enough defined for the bewildered: comprising the Greek words anthro (male) and gyne (female), it suggests the unity rather than the necessary separation of what we have come to think of as masculine and feminine qualities,” Heilbrun wrote in her article. \n\n“For the hostile, who in some sense feel threatened by this unfamiliar idea, further assurance is required. Androgyny does not mean the loss of all distinctions; those who are terrified by the word probably envision everyone, man and woman, dressed indistinguishably, like members of the Chinese Army. Those who are terrified further assume that in robbing us of clearly delineated sexual models, androgyny will rob us of all order and sanity. If we are to have more than two accepted role models — in youth, the quarterback and the cheerleader, in later life, the corporation manager and the corporation manager’s wife — will we not, in fact, be diving off the edge of an ordered world into the abyss?”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bce0d2e34d4af6a859feda593e79d9fa/623bcbbaa00b928d-a6/s540x810/2f713e2fbf89ec9690832101c9b995292b505d5f.jpg)\n\nOf course, as Heilbrun notes, “between the quarterback and the cheerleader, we have lost too much of our humanity; we have come close to losing humanity altogether.” [In interviews](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/exclusive-hedi-slimane-on-saint-laurents-126446645943.html)\n, Hedi Slimane says he created his razor-slim look partly because he didn’t identify with the equally extreme, stony exteriors of Mr. Olympia bodybuilders, a masculine archetype popular in the ‘90s. The received ideas of masculine and feminine clothing don’t just lock people into the confines of gender; they insist on expressions that don’t fully reflect the spectrum of human possibility.\n\n“In an androgynous world, men would be unable to escape their humanity by putting on the aggressive attitudes of maleness; women would be unable to escape theirs by adopting the passive attitudes society has urged on females,” Heilbrun writes. “This seems a small enough price if we can bring humanity, to its salvation, back toward the center of the masculine‐feminine spectrum. We may even discover the gentleness of men, the forcefulness of women, and not be afraid.”\n\nSince the gender revolution of the 1960s and ‘70s, however, only women have really crossed the divide. Today, most clothing websites still operate on a “men’s” and “women’s” navigation menu, and while women occasionally shop in the men’s section — buying menswear in small sizes at [Odin](https://odinnewyork.com/)\n, [Totokaelo](https://totokaelo.com)\n, and [Dover Street Market](https://www.doverstreetmarket.com/)\n — the reverse rarely happens. At the same time, something interesting is occurring. First, unisex fashion is emerging for the second time. Today, brands such as [Lemaire](https://www.lemaire.fr/)\n, [69](https://sixty-nine.us/)\n, [Telfar](http://www.telfar.net/)\n, [Olderbrother](https://olderbrother.us/)\n, [Smock](https://www.mohawkgeneralstore.com/collections/smock-1)\n, and [Studio Nicholson](https://www.studionicholson.com/)\n are neither strictly masculine nor feminine. Instead, their clothes are just as loose in their identity as their cut. “I would like to see anybody wearing my clothes,” says queer fashion designer [Claire Fleury](http://www.clairefleury.com/)\n. “And I do mean anybody.”\n\nMore women than ever before are also wearing traditional men’s clothing — and they do so in ways that reflect the untrammeled creativity in capital-f fashion, a realm traditionally reserved for them. Even for guys who like traditional men’s style, it’s hard not to notice the number of stylish women in men’s attire, and in doing so, take inspiration on how they can wear clothes in new ways.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/60f9710a35e84fada389fc2bddc48baf/623bcbbaa00b928d-2b/s540x810/f07fce2c4705740b69735b81cb4f6cd66fe9f25b.jpg)\n\n[Emilie Casiez](https://www.instagram.com/emiliecsz/?hl=en)\n, a designer at [Nigel Cabourn](https://www.cabourn.com/)\n, is a perfect example. Born and raised in Paris, she grew up in a multi-cultural family with deep roots in the clothing trade. Her French great-grandmother had a lace factory in the north of France; her Japanese mother worked for Maison Grès, a leading French couturier for her generation. When Casiez was just fourteen years old, she attended her first fashion show with the accompaniment of her mother. The show impressed her so much, she decided that night that she’d pursue a career in the rag trade. Casiez went on to study fashion design at Studio Berçot, a private training institute in Paris, and then started her eponymous label during her second year of college. And while her company made clothes for both men and women, the women’s side of her Haut Marais boutique stocked traditionally femme clothes — delicate wool cardigans, thigh-length dresses, and jersey tops with cute, whimsical drawings.\n\nFifteen years later, Casiez’s wardrobe looks very different. After having moved to Japan to work for Tsumori Chisato, another traditionally femme label, Casiez met the British designer Nigel Cabourn, who’s known for his vintage-inspired workwear and expedition gear. The two struck up a friendship and started going to flea markets together whenever they happened to be in the same city. At some point, Cabourn asked Casiez how she would envision a womenswear collection under his label — so she sketched out a few designs. “I was really inspired by the challenge and felt I could add a feminine, modern touch to the women’s collection,” she tells me. “Nigel loved the drawings, and we realized we had the same vision for the women’s line.”\n\nToday, Casiez works for Nigel Cabourn, designing the company’s Lybro and Authentic Woman’s collections, as well as some of the mainline pieces produced in Japan. Nigel Cabourn’s Lybro, a reinvigoration of classic British workwear brand Lybro (established 1927), channels the practical details of traditional workwear, such as chore coats and coveralls rendered in heavy Japanese denim. On someone feminine, their unisex, pomegranate-colored [“Frankie’s shirt”](https://www.cabourn.com/unisex-frankies-shirt-red)\n looks like a dainty, floral button-up. On someone masculine, it’s a Brazillian surf shirt. On someone androgynous, it could be the swinging, psychedelic style of London’s [Granny Takes a Trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Mpd5N1ISs)\n.\n\nNigel Cabourn also has a “proper” womenswear collection under their Authentic label, but its masculine edges are unmistakable. “Nigel and I start with a concept every season, and then we hunt for vintage pieces that fit that theme,” Casiez explains. “Then I find the fabrics and work with our patternmakers to create the silhouettes I want. So while the two lines stem from the same concepts, the womenswear collection is interpreted in a way to create feminine outfits that go along with our menswear collection.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/27f6a0d108a29f1976d7455ebcb85497/623bcbbaa00b928d-37/s540x810/75c01615c1fb4a791ad0bf56ddd930cc17127405.jpg)\n\nNigel Cabourn’s Lybro and Authentic Woman’s lines show that gender expression in fashion doesn’t follow a straight line. Instead of eliminating gender signals entirely, androgynous fashion often combines masculine and feminine elements in a way that’s playful, which in turn makes the wearer’s gender glaringly obvious. This tradition has a rich history with figures such as Diane Keaton in the 1977 film _[Annie Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqVgCfZX-yE)\n,_ or how female punks and grunge musicians thrifted the same lumberjack flannels and combat boots as their male counterparts in the ‘90s.\n\nJo Paoletti, a Professor of American Studies at the University of Maryland, describes this as “sexy androgyny.” “Part of the appeal of adult unisex fashion was the sexy contrast between the wearer and the clothes, which actually called attention to the male or female body,” she writes in her book [Sex and Unisex: Fashion, Feminism, and the Sexual Revolution](https://rstyle.me/+tA3Ek_JjEEpwHiHGdR0KDQ)\n. It’s not just women, either. Some of the most famous examples of androgyny include the kings of rock royalty — the sequins-and-high-heels-wearing likes of Prince, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, who were once the sex symbols of heterosexual masculinity.\n\nAt the same time, [one of the first “out” gay male subcultures was the Castro Clone](https://putthison.com/straight-copying-how-gay-fashion-goes-mainstream/)\n. Men who grew up with the idea that being gay necessarily meant being effeminate looked toward the traditional images of rugged masculinity for a new identity. Castro Clones dressed with the care of Edwardian dandies, but the look was cowboy or bushy workman: tight blue jeans, plaid shirts, leather vests or bomber jackets, and boots. “In the 1970s, gays were much more visible and less concerned about being recognized as gay,” Max Mosher wrote in “Out of the Closet.” “Clones had taken the look of the working-class male and sexualized it, emphasizing muscles through tight t-shirts, and shapely buttocks through deliberately shrunken jeans.”\n\nThis soupy mix of androgynous dress history shows how clothes can be worn in complex ways to communicate different messages. [Nigel Cabourn Woman’s Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/nigelcabourn_woman/?hl=en)\n is full of examples of how masculine attire can be worn in a feminine manner. And, closing the loop, it’s a treasure trove of menswear inspiration. Casiez’s feminine style shows masculine men how they can wear workwear in new ways. In the photo above, she sports a cropped, off-the-shoulder jacket with slim-straight jeans and visually heavy shoes — a silhouette that works on either men or women. In many of the photos below, she combines wide, high-waisted pants with extra-long coats, as well as jumpsuits with heavy-duty outerwear. “I like to wear matching colors, such as pulling a color through in a hat or cap,” she says. “For example, I love wearing a denim outfit from head-to-toe, and mixing vintage pieces with our Mainline and Lybro clothing.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ce42e45baa5f682501bcf270e53ffd5/623bcbbaa00b928d-37/s540x810/cac4b5eb12af6f1bc81df4711d3f5ee79508fee5.jpg)\n\nBeing a designer for Nigel Cabourn, Casiez is constantly referencing vintage workwear. “Vintage is a big inspiration for us, and we’re always looking for rare workwear pieces from the 1930s through to the ‘60s,” she says. “I live in Paris, but Nigel and I often meet in London to go to Spitalfields Market, Shoreditch vintage stores, or even war museums to research for a collection. We’ve gone to the Polish Army Museum in Warsaw and Airborne Assault Museum in England. I’ve seen so many crazy pieces in vintage archives. One of the more recent things includes an electrically heated, flight suit liner with matching gloves and sleepers, which was worn by the Royal Air Force in WW2.”\n\nAn inveterate thrifter, Casiez has an enviable collection of vintage clothing. Among her favorites is a US baseball jacket from the 1950s. “It has thick, white leather sleeves and a black wool body with red and beige striped ribs. It’s a bit big on me, and the leather is cracked in some places, but that’s what makes it cool,” she says. “I also have a 1940s Land Army stone dress, which I believe was adapted from a piece of workwear around the same period. It has a fitted top, big, pleated sleeves, and an A-line shaped skirt that make it very stylish and wearable. And I love my Swiss Army camo raincoat, which I bought at Spitalfields Market in London. It was apparently once owned by someone who worked on the film _Star Wars_.”\n\nFor a bit of Casiez-inspired style in your wardrobe, start with [Nigel Cabourn’s outerwear](https://www.cabourn.com/)\n (brands such as [Chimala](https://rstyle.me/+AjS2WN_o1VN_IkeBDJb8JA)\n, [Orslow](https://www.thebureaubelfast.com/shop/brand/orslow)\n, and [RRL](https://rstyle.me/+Re1pMUFyhLPORCocJc6-qA)\n are great accompaniments). An oversized coat — either loose and long, or cropped and wide — can look great with slim-straight jeans. You can also try denim alternatives, such as [olive fatigues](https://www.stanray.com/collections/pants)\n, [Carhartt double-knee pants](https://rstyle.me/+vEXRAtyeM1uFsce-kb8ORw)\n, and [workwear styled chinos](https://leftfieldnyc.com/collections/chinos)\n. Cuff your pants a little higher if you’re wearing chunky boots or high-top sneakers (Casiez often wears Nigel Cabourn’s collaboration with [Mihara Yasuhiro](http://www.phaeton-co.com/?pid=139799279)\n, although you can get a similar effect through [Chuck Taylor 70s](https://rstyle.me/+AMj8pImxMP1PjgXASJ1CVA)\n). Casiez’s outfits work because they stay within a theme, but her style also has a strong direction because she knows how to play around with the cut and details of her clothes.

March of 1973, when men wore long hair and women sported bell-bottom jeans, _The New York Times_ published an article by pioneering feminist scholar Carolyn Heilbrun. The article, titled [“Androgynous World,”](https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/19/archives/androgynous-world.html)\n is about the persistence of the androgynous ideal. The United States at this time was at a flashpoint. While gender stereotypes were becoming more rigid, fashionistas and feminists were imagining a freer future. About five years earlier, Pierre Cardin and Paco Rabanne conjured up streamlined “Space Age” jumpsuits made from stretchy, synthetic fabrics as a way to imagine a unisex world. Second-wave feminists were also pushing back against the gender stereotypes of the previous decade. Many feminists believed girls were being lured into their subservient roles by first accepting gendered clothing expectations. To be equal to men, they’d dress like them – or, at least, in ways that weren’t traditionally feminine.\n\n“The idea of androgyny apparently takes a little getting used to. First responses tend either toward bewilderment or hostility. The word itself is easily enough defined for the bewildered: comprising the Greek words anthro (male) and gyne (female), it suggests the unity rather than the necessary separation of what we have come to think of as masculine and feminine qualities,” Heilbrun wrote in her article. \n\n“For the hostile, who in some sense feel threatened by this unfamiliar idea, further assurance is required. Androgyny does not mean the loss of all distinctions; those who are terrified by the word probably envision everyone, man and woman, dressed indistinguishably, like members of the Chinese Army. Those who are terrified further assume that in robbing us of clearly delineated sexual models, androgyny will rob us of all order and sanity. If we are to have more than two accepted role models — in youth, the quarterback and the cheerleader, in later life, the corporation manager and the corporation manager’s wife — will we not, in fact, be diving off the edge of an ordered world into the abyss?”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bce0d2e34d4af6a859feda593e79d9fa/623bcbbaa00b928d-a6/s540x810/2f713e2fbf89ec9690832101c9b995292b505d5f.jpg)\n\nOf course, as Heilbrun notes, “between the quarterback and the cheerleader, we have lost too much of our humanity; we have come close to losing humanity altogether.” [In interviews](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/exclusive-hedi-slimane-on-saint-laurents-126446645943.html)\n, Hedi Slimane says he created his razor-slim look partly because he didn’t identify with the equally extreme, stony exteriors of Mr. Olympia bodybuilders, a masculine archetype popular in the ‘90s. The received ideas of masculine and feminine clothing don’t just lock people into the confines of gender; they insist on expressions that don’t fully reflect the spectrum of human possibility.\n\n“In an androgynous world, men would be unable to escape their humanity by putting on the aggressive attitudes of maleness; women would be unable to escape theirs by adopting the passive attitudes society has urged on females,” Heilbrun writes. “This seems a small enough price if we can bring humanity, to its salvation, back toward the center of the masculine‐feminine spectrum. We may even discover the gentleness of men, the forcefulness of women, and not be afraid.”\n\nSince the gender revolution of the 1960s and ‘70s, however, only women have really crossed the divide. Today, most clothing websites still operate on a “men’s” and “women’s” navigation menu, and while women occasionally shop in the men’s section — buying menswear in small sizes at [Odin](https://odinnewyork.com/)\n, [Totokaelo](https://totokaelo.com)\n, and [Dover Street Market](https://www.doverstreetmarket.com/)\n — the reverse rarely happens. At the same time, something interesting is occurring. First, unisex fashion is emerging for the second time. Today, brands such as [Lemaire](https://www.lemaire.fr/)\n, [69](https://sixty-nine.us/)\n, [Telfar](http://www.telfar.net/)\n, [Olderbrother](https://olderbrother.us/)\n, [Smock](https://www.mohawkgeneralstore.com/collections/smock-1)\n, and [Studio Nicholson](https://www.studionicholson.com/)\n are neither strictly masculine nor feminine. Instead, their clothes are just as loose in their identity as their cut. “I would like to see anybody wearing my clothes,” says queer fashion designer [Claire Fleury](http://www.clairefleury.com/)\n. “And I do mean anybody.”\n\nMore women than ever before are also wearing traditional men’s clothing — and they do so in ways that reflect the untrammeled creativity in capital-f fashion, a realm traditionally reserved for them. Even for guys who like traditional men’s style, it’s hard not to notice the number of stylish women in men’s attire, and in doing so, take inspiration on how they can wear clothes in new ways.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/60f9710a35e84fada389fc2bddc48baf/623bcbbaa00b928d-2b/s540x810/f07fce2c4705740b69735b81cb4f6cd66fe9f25b.jpg)\n\n[Emilie Casiez](https://www.instagram.com/emiliecsz/?hl=en)\n, a designer at [Nigel Cabourn](https://www.cabourn.com/)\n, is a perfect example. Born and raised in Paris, she grew up in a multi-cultural family with deep roots in the clothing trade. Her French great-grandmother had a lace factory in the north of France; her Japanese mother worked for Maison Grès, a leading French couturier for her generation. When Casiez was just fourteen years old, she attended her first fashion show with the accompaniment of her mother. The show impressed her so much, she decided that night that she’d pursue a career in the rag trade. Casiez went on to study fashion design at Studio Berçot, a private training institute in Paris, and then started her eponymous label during her second year of college. And while her company made clothes for both men and women, the women’s side of her Haut Marais boutique stocked traditionally femme clothes — delicate wool cardigans, thigh-length dresses, and jersey tops with cute, whimsical drawings.\n\nFifteen years later, Casiez’s wardrobe looks very different. After having moved to Japan to work for Tsumori Chisato, another traditionally femme label, Casiez met the British designer Nigel Cabourn, who’s known for his vintage-inspired workwear and expedition gear. The two struck up a friendship and started going to flea markets together whenever they happened to be in the same city. At some point, Cabourn asked Casiez how she would envision a womenswear collection under his label — so she sketched out a few designs. “I was really inspired by the challenge and felt I could add a feminine, modern touch to the women’s collection,” she tells me. “Nigel loved the drawings, and we realized we had the same vision for the women’s line.”\n\nToday, Casiez works for Nigel Cabourn, designing the company’s Lybro and Authentic Woman’s collections, as well as some of the mainline pieces produced in Japan. Nigel Cabourn’s Lybro, a reinvigoration of classic British workwear brand Lybro (established 1927), channels the practical details of traditional workwear, such as chore coats and coveralls rendered in heavy Japanese denim. On someone feminine, their unisex, pomegranate-colored [“Frankie’s shirt”](https://www.cabourn.com/unisex-frankies-shirt-red)\n looks like a dainty, floral button-up. On someone masculine, it’s a Brazillian surf shirt. On someone androgynous, it could be the swinging, psychedelic style of London’s [Granny Takes a Trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Mpd5N1ISs)\n.\n\nNigel Cabourn also has a “proper” womenswear collection under their Authentic label, but its masculine edges are unmistakable. “Nigel and I start with a concept every season, and then we hunt for vintage pieces that fit that theme,” Casiez explains. “Then I find the fabrics and work with our patternmakers to create the silhouettes I want. So while the two lines stem from the same concepts, the womenswear collection is interpreted in a way to create feminine outfits that go along with our menswear collection.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/27f6a0d108a29f1976d7455ebcb85497/623bcbbaa00b928d-37/s540x810/75c01615c1fb4a791ad0bf56ddd930cc17127405.jpg)\n\nNigel Cabourn’s Lybro and Authentic Woman’s lines show that gender expression in fashion doesn’t follow a straight line. Instead of eliminating gender signals entirely, androgynous fashion often combines masculine and feminine elements in a way that’s playful, which in turn makes the wearer’s gender glaringly obvious. This tradition has a rich history with figures such as Diane Keaton in the 1977 film _[Annie Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqVgCfZX-yE)\n,_ or how female punks and grunge musicians thrifted the same lumberjack flannels and combat boots as their male counterparts in the ‘90s.\n\nJo Paoletti, a Professor of American Studies at the University of Maryland, describes this as “sexy androgyny.” “Part of the appeal of adult unisex fashion was the sexy contrast between the wearer and the clothes, which actually called attention to the male or female body,” she writes in her book [Sex and Unisex: Fashion, Feminism, and the Sexual Revolution](https://rstyle.me/+tA3Ek_JjEEpwHiHGdR0KDQ)\n. It’s not just women, either. Some of the most famous examples of androgyny include the kings of rock royalty — the sequins-and-high-heels-wearing likes of Prince, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, who were once the sex symbols of heterosexual masculinity.\n\nAt the same time, [one of the first “out” gay male subcultures was the Castro Clone](https://putthison.com/straight-copying-how-gay-fashion-goes-mainstream/)\n. Men who grew up with the idea that being gay necessarily meant being effeminate looked toward the traditional images of rugged masculinity for a new identity. Castro Clones dressed with the care of Edwardian dandies, but the look was cowboy or bushy workman: tight blue jeans, plaid shirts, leather vests or bomber jackets, and boots. “In the 1970s, gays were much more visible and less concerned about being recognized as gay,” Max Mosher wrote in “Out of the Closet.” “Clones had taken the look of the working-class male and sexualized it, emphasizing muscles through tight t-shirts, and shapely buttocks through deliberately shrunken jeans.”\n\nThis soupy mix of androgynous dress history shows how clothes can be worn in complex ways to communicate different messages. [Nigel Cabourn Woman’s Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/nigelcabourn_woman/?hl=en)\n is full of examples of how masculine attire can be worn in a feminine manner. And, closing the loop, it’s a treasure trove of menswear inspiration. Casiez’s feminine style shows masculine men how they can wear workwear in new ways. In the photo above, she sports a cropped, off-the-shoulder jacket with slim-straight jeans and visually heavy shoes — a silhouette that works on either men or women. In many of the photos below, she combines wide, high-waisted pants with extra-long coats, as well as jumpsuits with heavy-duty outerwear. “I like to wear matching colors, such as pulling a color through in a hat or cap,” she says. “For example, I love wearing a denim outfit from head-to-toe, and mixing vintage pieces with our Mainline and Lybro clothing.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ce42e45baa5f682501bcf270e53ffd5/623bcbbaa00b928d-37/s540x810/cac4b5eb12af6f1bc81df4711d3f5ee79508fee5.jpg)\n\nBeing a designer for Nigel Cabourn, Casiez is constantly referencing vintage workwear. “Vintage is a big inspiration for us, and we’re always looking for rare workwear pieces from the 1930s through to the ‘60s,” she says. “I live in Paris, but Nigel and I often meet in London to go to Spitalfields Market, Shoreditch vintage stores, or even war museums to research for a collection. We’ve gone to the Polish Army Museum in Warsaw and Airborne Assault Museum in England. I’ve seen so many crazy pieces in vintage archives. One of the more recent things includes an electrically heated, flight suit liner with matching gloves and sleepers, which was worn by the Royal Air Force in WW2.”\n\nAn inveterate thrifter, Casiez has an enviable collection of vintage clothing. Among her favorites is a US baseball jacket from the 1950s. “It has thick, white leather sleeves and a black wool body with red and beige striped ribs. It’s a bit big on me, and the leather is cracked in some places, but that’s what makes it cool,” she says. “I also have a 1940s Land Army stone dress, which I believe was adapted from a piece of workwear around the same period. It has a fitted top, big, pleated sleeves, and an A-line shaped skirt that make it very stylish and wearable. And I love my Swiss Army camo raincoat, which I bought at Spitalfields Market in London. It was apparently once owned by someone who worked on the film _Star Wars_.”\n\nFor a bit of Casiez-inspired style in your wardrobe, start with [Nigel Cabourn’s outerwear](https://www.cabourn.com/)\n (brands such as [Chimala](https://rstyle.me/+AjS2WN_o1VN_IkeBDJb8JA)\n, [Orslow](https://www.thebureaubelfast.com/shop/brand/orslow)\n, and [RRL](https://rstyle.me/+Re1pMUFyhLPORCocJc6-qA)\n are great accompaniments). An oversized coat — either loose and long, or cropped and wide — can look great with slim-straight jeans. You can also try denim alternatives, such as [olive fatigues](https://www.stanray.com/collections/pants)\n, [Carhartt double-knee pants](https://rstyle.me/+vEXRAtyeM1uFsce-kb8ORw)\n, and [workwear styled chinos](https://leftfieldnyc.com/collections/chinos)\n. Cuff your pants a little higher if you’re wearing chunky boots or high-top sneakers (Casiez often wears Nigel Cabourn’s collaboration with [Mihara Yasuhiro](http://www.phaeton-co.com/?pid=139799279)\n, although you can get a similar effect through [Chuck Taylor 70s](https://rstyle.me/+AMj8pImxMP1PjgXASJ1CVA)\n). Casiez’s outfits work because they stay within a theme, but her style also has a strong direction because she knows how to play around with the cut and details of her clothes. When I ask if she has tips on how to wear wide-legged pants, a challenging silhouette, she says: “If you look at how Nigel and I wear it, I think it says it all!” \n\n_For more of [Emilie

Matt Damon, as the film’s anti-hero Tom Ripley, borrows a Princeton jacket from a friend while working as as a piano player at a party. The Ivy League jacket ends up getting him the attention of a wealthy shipbuilder, who thinks that Tom went to Princeton with his son Dickie. He sends Tom away to Europe, hoping Tom can convince his ne’er-do-well son to come back home from southern Italy. Having left his bleak Manhattan life, however, Tom becomes enraptured by Dickie’s charming dilettante lifestyle. So he strikes up a Faustian bargain and steals it. “If I could just go back … if I could rub everything out … starting with myself, starting with borrowing a jacket,” Tom silently dreams to himself at the beginning of the film. And doesn’t Tom’s line neatly sum up what we all wish for when we purchase a new jacket or pair of shoes? The fantasy that it’ll somehow magically transform our mundane lives? (Well, maybe without the murderous crime.)\n\nThe film is important to fashion in other ways. Every summer, men reference Anthony Minghella’s chilling thriller as one of their favorite sources for warm weather style inspiration. _The Talented Mr. Ripley_ captures the feeling of being young and carefree, not unlike the films of French New Wave, but with more of a _la dolce vita_ vibe and touristy idyllic scenes of a sun-drenched 1950s Italy. It’s a hypnotic, voluptuously beautiful film with tons of references to menswear cliches: inherited wealth, Ivy League education, and an impossibly glamourous lifestyle in an Italian seaside town. \n\nFor that Dickie Greenleaf vibe, even if not its literal look, you can turn to [Joyce](https://www.joyce.international/)\n. The relatively new brand offers the same laid-back, vacation style that defines the film. Their clothes are loosely cut, retro-inspired, and pair well with tortoiseshell sunglasses and well-mixed martinis. The company even has the same America-to-Italy backstory. The idea for the brand was first seeded when John Walters, the company’s founder, was working as a product designer in New York. However, it didn’t materialize until Walters visited his girlfriend in Florence, Italy (where they now both live). Today, it’s based out of their Florentine studio, while product fulfillment takes place out of Indian Wells, California. “Stylistically, our online visuals reference a lot of [Pink Floyd’s earlier works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66DorOv86nc)\n, as well as some of Alain Delon’s films, such as _[Purple Noon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdQZXUOHGMs)\n_ and _[The Swimming Pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-Y_6pnkN20)\n,_” says Walters. “Aside from that, we also get a lot of our style inspiration from traveling.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/63bd88f7fad554df09a006e55554b584/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-7c/s540x810/9f081b67969f285745e56b74f367a17c430b1da6.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1a0ddb386995ca581c6752897467944c/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-f0/s540x810/6e89fb14299ade217ba4e7c2fcd1b59ea7911a0e.jpg)\n\nAs a brand, Joyce works surprisingly well as a summer uniform. The clothes have just enough detailing to push them away from business casual, but still allow you to wear only a button-up and chinos on hot, humid days. Their lightweight, cotton pants have a slim-straight leg, medium-rise, and subtle, double reverse pleats to give them an old-school Italian sensibility. Their shorts have a tie-waist for style, but both their trousers and shorts are mostly held up using elasticated waistbands. Best of all are the shirts. Made from rayon, silk, and bouncy linens, they look as good as they feel. They’re not strictly contemporary or classic, but have a Dickie Greenleaf style with the color palette of Giorgio Armani.\n\nJoyce sources all of their fabrics from jobbers, an industry term for people who sell mill ends, odd lots, and factory seconds. In the textile industry, mills typically run a little more than what a customer orders. So, if a big design house commissions 1,000 meters of a specific cloth, the mill will run 1,100 meters. This way, if there are tiny imperfections, the designer still has 1,000 meters of usable fabric. The unused, excess cloth then ends up in the hands of a jobber, who will resell it to private individuals, fabric stores, and small designers. With a keen eye and a lot of dedication, a designer such as Walters can burrow himself into mountains of fabric at one of these jobber warehouses (pictured above) and emerge with something great.\n\n“There’s an entire industry built on the excess of established houses; it’s quite something,” says Walters. “The fabrics we use range from vintage to overruns. When we source fabrics, we start with a product in mind. Otherwise, it’s easy to get carried away and buy something because of its feel and limited availability. Generally speaking, we seek out raw, natural fabrics in earthy tones.” For summer, that means soft, breathable fabrics, such as lightweight cotton, springy linen, and most of all, rayon.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d3f215d2adb909642cf8bf0dca8627f0/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-f5/s540x810/61162b4bb832ff99e4e3d0fd08000a962170b17e.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8271ede5812ac4437fb10a773443512/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-cb/s540x810/8b87a8f333bd309c9c1f6b6a86d87e5a780f1da9.jpg)\n\nRayon is summer’s most magical fiber. Like plastic, it’s a child of the Great Depression, and while its foundation was laid sometime in the 19th century, it didn’t become widely popular until the interwar years. The emergence of rayon coincided with an era in modern art when designers were articulating the meaning of industrial modernity (e.g., Futurism’s glorification of machines and Art Deco’s sleek industrial look). Ezra Pound’s 1934 injunction to “Make It New” would later serve as a shorthand for modernism’s infatuation with all things novel. The interwar period was a time when the public still had faith that technology could serve as a countervailing force against social and economic stagnation. So it’s no surprise that, when marketers introduced rayon as a better and more affordable alternative to silk, people were eager to get with the times.\n\nRayon is made from mashed-up wood pulp, which has been chemically processed and then extruded through a machine, much like how a chef might make spaghetti. Those strands are then spun into yarns, which in turn are used to make fabrics. Authors of textile books can’t seem to agree whether rayon should be classified as natural because it’s made from regenerated cellulose fibers, or artificial because of its chemical processing. Perhaps it’s both. In any case, rayon is exceedingly comfortable, feels cool to the touch, and typically has soft, silky texture (although, it can also be made to feel like wool, cotton, or linen). “Rayon provides the ideal drape that you can’t achieve with cotton,” Walters explains. “When blended, rayon adds strength to the fabric.”\n\nThe downside of rayon is that it can’t be machine washed. Instead, most garment manufacturers recommend you either dry clean or hand wash it. I’ve had success hand washing all my rayon garments in the sink with a bit of [sud-less, rinse-free Soak detergent](https://rstyle.me/+nV6fAENuF0t0-s3hmTsFZw)\n, although anything gentle should do. Rayon also can’t be ironed, as the extreme heat can scorch it, but I find wrinkles naturally fall out within an hour (with the exception of rayons made to feel like linen, for obvious reasons). The good news is that, since rayon doesn’t hold odors as easily as cotton or linen, you can get away with two or three wearings before needing to clean it.  \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3b8ed7303a73fbf850997cd654c89943/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-6b/s540x810/681d45969df41732681a455912ef25e229997546.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/33733a60e81f32fc760cdeb37f223de4/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-e9/s540x810/2d132a1986c666adccd7e331c6b69659c78ff28d.jpg)\n\nI bought two shirts from Joyce earlier this month. [The first is the company’s signature M001](https://www.joyce.international/collections/shirts/products/model-001-in-paolo)\n, one of their first products, in a deadstock Italian viscose, which has a silky hand. The shirt features a camp collar, relaxed fit, and handpainted design (although that design has been digitally transferred onto the fabric). The shirt goes surprisingly well with [3sixteen’s slim-straight jeans](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/bottoms/products/sl100x-straight-raw-indigo-selvedge-denim)\n and [Yuketen’s woven huaraches](https://bit.ly/32xhbP1)\n. [The M005](https://www.joyce.international/collections/shirts/products/m005-oversized-shirt-in-russet)\n, on the other hand, is a bit more challenging with a wider, cropped silhouette that I find works better as an overshirt than a button-up. That one ultimately got returned, although I can see it working on certain people.\n\nThere are some things about their construction I feel could be improved. I wish the shirts featured a single chest pocket, which would be useful on a jacket-less summer uniform. The stitching could also be cleaner, especially on the more slippery rayon shirt. And I found the size tag, which is sewn into the shirt’s interior side-seam, to be a bit itchy against bare skin, although it was easy enough to snip off. That said, the prices are refreshingly affordable in today’s fashion world. Shorts are just $149, chinos are $189, and shirts start at $179. The company also has a reasonable 14-day return window. \n\nWalters tells me that, later this year, the company will debut its first autumn/ winter collection. “It’ll skew more towards the temperate winter climes of Los Angeles or Barcelona,” he explains. “Our production is fairly short-sighted by design, but for now, we’re looking at producing some autumn shirting and unconstructed cashmere coats. As far as materials, we’re exploring virgin wool, viscose blends, cashmere, and raw silk.” For most brands, spring/ summer collections can feel like an afterthought, whereas fall/ winter is where they truly shine. Given how excellent Joyce’s warm-weather clothes look, they’ve set a high bar for themselves. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e24a0a58ccdc972b85d4d9717914a14/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-1d/s540x810/c9d9aa66946943d5baa3635bc35ec586187ec43d.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c71307c6944232a5c795f7cdd1d6f57/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-f2/s540x810/cf313a491f16c75905e249076019770572b521f9.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7fb0c5458dadbdcb2f7f9e8d4fcaaa6/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-91/s540x810/18ba5d4be0202f5c1710cb0c037f631f8ebd112d.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/21c64cd2beda49b3194659a5cb0d268e/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-56/s540x810/1ae694942d298c637d81c3c857947f034cdb522f.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed19d62597a27e178794c7d4d5bfa654/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-1a/s540x810/52746c005abd2a1d92997214be7e41e8825dba9e.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/53a265e70b1e039f4f3b065d9dc2ff8d/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-ad/s540x810/dcad7a18cb14c61a3654ce8b8aefc56677bb8ca5.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b84cdc04501538bd19412e80661421b9/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-41/s540x810/9d42a2d9e8298d9f0fc8c6cef88fe2d96620522a.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b55bb7c68d62e263f2b2ddac697790ca/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-d6/s540x810/96ca8202d5bddceb2250836bdc87ca36a43fef42.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9902456106a82a45f3710457bc1b345c/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-7f/s540x810/a4e3556d63a8bb95e3244bfd5e9cbf6ef98ff0dd.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/69976d88c3659a83a5ea6cb7f345962d/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-4b/s540x810/f0ebdbd90912cfa2329e1d045989f92b14549694.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c54d38dccfee65d6226c4cb9d7cb5484/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-92/s540x810/c69e65676cca14e62f37e9283a114529d0b61786.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/307a41fffef2f3945c8640daeb585eed/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-21/s540x810/30b4a0020fbd7e7feb611b87d2eaea1d26313bc3.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fea64496e62c0969b2fb6732e12d7e6f/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-31/s540x810/cc6121442964d6162a4bbec85cf1cf0937b11c2f.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/decf856e355d43ee619abbd844ff6952/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-3e/s540x810/863bf2bd91e5f431b742749ab1d4c39781a8ad5d.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7cd270773e7198a4908944afbe2141f3/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-3f/s540x810/27abea318762c88058107cfa15da63e791207ca6.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/adf58e59f7a32504dc77a32fce4a82c9/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-03/s540x810/041e14f90deb5b0725721ae4b6de4538d28fcc5d.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7cfecd579d46509e17974f300e9f5595/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-40/s540x810/6374661c6cb75a5e181d1d010f5ec48be96f5e8a.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/05378a7b858de31c3205ed64676c236b/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-a4/s540x810/4a21a62e534140160a07f32df39ba91fca36e0f8.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/30facd874dec21689e63fd92a99b9797/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-49/s540x810/a1d1697b82fa71cb2408930cb970dc1dbd9bb199.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce53034f0a1be758382506ef240192cf/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-e6/s540x810/ed60808f0153d0769fb9e556ff1e96b0c14b2cee.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f294c5d54c409cb83a1ada6cd130bf2d/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-68/s540x810/c2d78044f11cf7a8b6a53ced24fb9108cec5aa0b.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/022337c71fa7bccf6c50a2cb182909ab/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-82/s540x810/91bd734ea8cc2426d0f19817663b522f48a4c5a3.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2377e4dc2d947169a02fcb0bad5259df/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-d7/s540x810/33ab63a1973d50773afb1eef7478a4e95cc4b8bf.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/374df0d1d203ab74c4f8bcb49dbdc688/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-b6/s540x810/bd4f22b4281f0581b5a9a902a820a37461808c29.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd25f03c5c0458365d9f3168596fd019/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-0f/s540x810/5c91fa435301d8ae747f0d61dc1e618e561fe192.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc8f89c4ff7b397f0d0da025c80f5fa5/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-c0/s540x810/526b95fdc0ffa67e48d11333c49c8956e5551b51.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d6eae1dc83046fb73266bc121c02d0ad/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-84/s540x810/e9553e0b950f980affe223cb7badedf981667152.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f7340a59f6eb6ff82ccda05fd65d93f/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-0f/s540x810/3a97d007c41ed0c00f9ed96bb97c6750a60de5ef.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d4c960eb2f28855599fce2dc505cd53e/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-20/s540x810/abb1f52d3420e6ed526e3df78fdedb4dc8bfe853.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c65b0ae15e9a4e136b06f1a59fdc85e4/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-de/s540x810/b4b76113dc624af8020c61b54f8e9409197cd3cb.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f869ae354ebe0c34fb4d22652ec91ecb/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-f4/s540x810/41eea41f638471d0326e324b721e1d551c7e3b06.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f8ff1a625be3bb068b140b819d63598e/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-69/s540x810/5b7b19a9e8a87a2578a81588cfcb36aae1fbba11.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f93aa8f3f30d496c5374591551a44398/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-ce/s540x810/b7b08edd15878b3180f00d1e4504abaeb9a18113.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9fe0e610915802752a17ba0ab56a5035/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-05/s540x810/a

Talented Mr. Ripley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUNost5-DIg)\n_, the film version and not the book, opens with a brilliantly economical line about clothes. Matt Damon, as the film’s anti-hero Tom Ripley, borrows a Princeton jacket from a friend while working as as a piano player at a party. The Ivy League jacket ends up getting him the attention of a wealthy shipbuilder, who thinks that Tom went to Princeton with his son Dickie. He sends Tom away to Europe, hoping Tom can convince his ne’er-do-well son to come back home from southern Italy. Having left his bleak Manhattan life, however, Tom becomes enraptured by Dickie’s charming dilettante lifestyle. So he strikes up a Faustian bargain and steals it. “If I could just go back … if I could rub everything out … starting with myself, starting with borrowing a jacket,” Tom silently dreams to himself at the beginning of the film. And doesn’t Tom’s line neatly sum up what we all wish for when we purchase a new jacket or pair of shoes? The fantasy that it’ll somehow magically transform our mundane lives? (Well, maybe without the murderous crime.)\n\nThe film is important to fashion in other ways. Every summer, men reference Anthony Minghella’s chilling thriller as one of their favorite sources for warm weather style inspiration. _The Talented Mr. Ripley_ captures the feeling of being young and carefree, not unlike the films of French New Wave, but with more of a _la dolce vita_ vibe and touristy idyllic scenes of a sun-drenched 1950s Italy. It’s a hypnotic, voluptuously beautiful film with tons of references to menswear cliches: inherited wealth, Ivy League education, and an impossibly glamourous lifestyle in an Italian seaside town. \n\nFor that Dickie Greenleaf vibe, even if not its literal look, you can turn to [Joyce](https://www.joyce.international/)\n. The relatively new brand offers the same laid-back, vacation style that defines the film. Their clothes are loosely cut, retro-inspired, and pair well with tortoiseshell sunglasses and well-mixed martinis. The company even has the same America-to-Italy backstory. The idea for the brand was first seeded when John Walters, the company’s founder, was working as a product designer in New York. However, it didn’t materialize until Walters visited his girlfriend in Florence, Italy (where they now both live). Today, it’s based out of their Florentine studio, while product fulfillment takes place out of Indian Wells, California. “Stylistically, our online visuals reference a lot of [Pink Floyd’s earlier works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66DorOv86nc)\n, as well as some of Alain Delon’s films, such as _[Purple Noon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdQZXUOHGMs)\n_ and _[The Swimming Pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-Y_6pnkN20)\n,_” says Walters. “Aside from that, we also get a lot of our style inspiration from traveling.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/63bd88f7fad554df09a006e55554b584/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-7c/s540x810/9f081b67969f285745e56b74f367a17c430b1da6.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1a0ddb386995ca581c6752897467944c/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-f0/s540x810/6e89fb14299ade217ba4e7c2fcd1b59ea7911a0e.jpg)\n\nAs a brand, Joyce works surprisingly well as a summer uniform. The clothes have just enough detailing to push them away from business casual, but still allow you to wear only a button-up and chinos on hot, humid days. Their lightweight, cotton pants have a slim-straight leg, medium-rise, and subtle, double reverse pleats to give them an old-school Italian sensibility. Their shorts have a tie-waist for style, but both their trousers and shorts are mostly held up using elasticated waistbands. Best of all are the shirts. Made from rayon, silk, and bouncy linens, they look as good as they feel. They’re not strictly contemporary or classic, but have a Dickie Greenleaf style with the color palette of Giorgio Armani.\n\nJoyce sources all of their fabrics from jobbers, an industry term for people who sell mill ends, odd lots, and factory seconds. In the textile industry, mills typically run a little more than what a customer orders. So, if a big design house commissions 1,000 meters of a specific cloth, the mill will run 1,100 meters. This way, if there are tiny imperfections, the designer still has 1,000 meters of usable fabric. The unused, excess cloth then ends up in the hands of a jobber, who will resell it to private individuals, fabric stores, and small designers. With a keen eye and a lot of dedication, a designer such as Walters can burrow himself into mountains of fabric at one of these jobber warehouses (pictured above) and emerge with something great.\n\n“There’s an entire industry built on the excess of established houses; it’s quite something,” says Walters. “The fabrics we use range from vintage to overruns. When we source fabrics, we start with a product in mind. Otherwise, it’s easy to get carried away and buy something because of its feel and limited availability. Generally speaking, we seek out raw, natural fabrics in earthy tones.” For summer, that means soft, breathable fabrics, such as lightweight cotton, springy linen, and most of all, rayon.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d3f215d2adb909642cf8bf0dca8627f0/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-f5/s540x810/61162b4bb832ff99e4e3d0fd08000a962170b17e.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8271ede5812ac4437fb10a773443512/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-cb/s540x810/8b87a8f333bd309c9c1f6b6a86d87e5a780f1da9.jpg)\n\nRayon is summer’s most magical fiber. Like plastic, it’s a child of the Great Depression, and while its foundation was laid sometime in the 19th century, it didn’t become widely popular until the interwar years. The emergence of rayon coincided with an era in modern art when designers were articulating the meaning of industrial modernity (e.g., Futurism’s glorification of machines and Art Deco’s sleek industrial look). Ezra Pound’s 1934 injunction to “Make It New” would later serve as a shorthand for modernism’s infatuation with all things novel. The interwar period was a time when the public still had faith that technology could serve as a countervailing force against social and economic stagnation. So it’s no surprise that, when marketers introduced rayon as a better and more affordable alternative to silk, people were eager to get with the times.\n\nRayon is made from mashed-up wood pulp, which has been chemically processed and then extruded through a machine, much like how a chef might make spaghetti. Those strands are then spun into yarns, which in turn are used to make fabrics. Authors of textile books can’t seem to agree whether rayon should be classified as natural because it’s made from regenerated cellulose fibers, or artificial because of its chemical processing. Perhaps it’s both. In any case, rayon is exceedingly comfortable, feels cool to the touch, and typically has soft, silky texture (although, it can also be made to feel like wool, cotton, or linen). “Rayon provides the ideal drape that you can’t achieve with cotton,” Walters explains. “When blended, rayon adds strength to the fabric.”\n\nThe downside of rayon is that it can’t be machine washed. Instead, most garment manufacturers recommend you either dry clean or hand wash it. I’ve had success hand washing all my rayon garments in the sink with a bit of [sud-less, rinse-free Soak detergent](https://rstyle.me/+nV6fAENuF0t0-s3hmTsFZw)\n, although anything gentle should do. Rayon also can’t be ironed, as the extreme heat can scorch it, but I find wrinkles naturally fall out within an hour (with the exception of rayons made to feel like linen, for obvious reasons). The good news is that, since rayon doesn’t hold odors as easily as cotton or linen, you can get away with two or three wearings before needing to clean it.  \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3b8ed7303a73fbf850997cd654c89943/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-6b/s540x810/681d45969df41732681a455912ef25e229997546.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/33733a60e81f32fc760cdeb37f223de4/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-e9/s540x810/2d132a1986c666adccd7e331c6b69659c78ff28d.jpg)\n\nI bought two shirts from Joyce earlier this month. [The first is the company’s signature M001](https://www.joyce.international/collections/shirts/products/model-001-in-paolo)\n, one of their first products, in a deadstock Italian viscose, which has a silky hand. The shirt features a camp collar, relaxed fit, and handpainted design (although that design has been digitally transferred onto the fabric). The shirt goes surprisingly well with [3sixteen’s slim-straight jeans](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/bottoms/products/sl100x-straight-raw-indigo-selvedge-denim)\n and [Yuketen’s woven huaraches](https://bit.ly/32xhbP1)\n. [The M005](https://www.joyce.international/collections/shirts/products/m005-oversized-shirt-in-russet)\n, on the other hand, is a bit more challenging with a wider, cropped silhouette that I find works better as an overshirt than a button-up. That one ultimately got returned, although I can see it working on certain people.\n\nThere are some things about their construction I feel could be improved. I wish the shirts featured a single chest pocket, which would be useful on a jacket-less summer uniform. The stitching could also be cleaner, especially on the more slippery rayon shirt. And I found the size tag, which is sewn into the shirt’s interior side-seam, to be a bit itchy against bare skin, although it was easy enough to snip off. That said, the prices are refreshingly affordable in today’s fashion world. Shorts are just $149, chinos are $189, and shirts start at $179. The company also has a reasonable 14-day return window. \n\nWalters tells me that, later this year, the company will debut its first autumn/ winter collection. “It’ll skew more towards the temperate winter climes of Los Angeles or Barcelona,” he explains. “Our production is fairly short-sighted by design, but for now, we’re looking at producing some autumn shirting and unconstructed cashmere coats. As far as materials, we’re exploring virgin wool, viscose blends, cashmere, and raw silk.” For most brands, spring/ summer collections can feel like an afterthought, whereas fall/ winter is where they truly shine. Given how excellent Joyce’s warm-weather clothes look, they’ve set a high bar for themselves. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e24a0a58ccdc972b85d4d9717914a14/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-1d/s540x810/c9d9aa66946943d5baa3635bc35ec586187ec43d.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c71307c6944232a5c795f7cdd1d6f57/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-f2/s540x810/cf313a491f16c75905e249076019770572b521f9.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7fb0c5458dadbdcb2f7f9e8d4fcaaa6/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-91/s540x810/18ba5d4be0202f5c1710cb0c037f631f8ebd112d.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/21c64cd2beda49b3194659a5cb0d268e/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-56/s540x810/1ae694942d298c637d81c3c857947f034cdb522f.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed19d62597a27e178794c7d4d5bfa654/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-1a/s540x810/52746c005abd2a1d92997214be7e41e8825dba9e.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/53a265e70b1e039f4f3b065d9dc2ff8d/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-ad/s540x810/dcad7a18cb14c61a3654ce8b8aefc56677bb8ca5.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b84cdc04501538bd19412e80661421b9/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-41/s540x810/9d42a2d9e8298d9f0fc8c6cef88fe2d96620522a.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b55bb7c68d62e263f2b2ddac697790ca/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-d6/s540x810/96ca8202d5bddceb2250836bdc87ca36a43fef42.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9902456106a82a45f3710457bc1b345c/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-7f/s540x810/a4e3556d63a8bb95e3244bfd5e9cbf6ef98ff0dd.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/69976d88c3659a83a5ea6cb7f345962d/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-4b/s540x810/f0ebdbd90912cfa2329e1d045989f92b14549694.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c54d38dccfee65d6226c4cb9d7cb5484/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-92/s540x810/c69e65676cca14e62f37e9283a114529d0b61786.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/307a41fffef2f3945c8640daeb585eed/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-21/s540x810/30b4a0020fbd7e7feb611b87d2eaea1d26313bc3.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fea64496e62c0969b2fb6732e12d7e6f/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-31/s540x810/cc6121442964d6162a4bbec85cf1cf0937b11c2f.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/decf856e355d43ee619abbd844ff6952/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-3e/s540x810/863bf2bd91e5f431b742749ab1d4c39781a8ad5d.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7cd270773e7198a4908944afbe2141f3/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-3f/s540x810/27abea318762c88058107cfa15da63e791207ca6.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/adf58e59f7a32504dc77a32fce4a82c9/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-03/s540x810/041e14f90deb5b0725721ae4b6de4538d28fcc5d.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7cfecd579d46509e17974f300e9f5595/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-40/s540x810/6374661c6cb75a5e181d1d010f5ec48be96f5e8a.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/05378a7b858de31c3205ed64676c236b/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-a4/s540x810/4a21a62e534140160a07f32df39ba91fca36e0f8.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/30facd874dec21689e63fd92a99b9797/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-49/s540x810/a1d1697b82fa71cb2408930cb970dc1dbd9bb199.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce53034f0a1be758382506ef240192cf/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-e6/s540x810/ed60808f0153d0769fb9e556ff1e96b0c14b2cee.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f294c5d54c409cb83a1ada6cd130bf2d/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-68/s540x810/c2d78044f11cf7a8b6a53ced24fb9108cec5aa0b.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/022337c71fa7bccf6c50a2cb182909ab/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-82/s540x810/91bd734ea8cc2426d0f19817663b522f48a4c5a3.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2377e4dc2d947169a02fcb0bad5259df/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-d7/s540x810/33ab63a1973d50773afb1eef7478a4e95cc4b8bf.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/374df0d1d203ab74c4f8bcb49dbdc688/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-b6/s540x810/bd4f22b4281f0581b5a9a902a820a37461808c29.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd25f03c5c0458365d9f3168596fd019/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-0f/s540x810/5c91fa435301d8ae747f0d61dc1e618e561fe192.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc8f89c4ff7b397f0d0da025c80f5fa5/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-c0/s540x810/526b95fdc0ffa67e48d11333c49c8956e5551b51.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d6eae1dc83046fb73266bc121c02d0ad/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-84/s540x810/e9553e0b950f980affe223cb7badedf981667152.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f7340a59f6eb6ff82ccda05fd65d93f/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-0f/s540x810/3a97d007c41ed0c00f9ed96bb97c6750a60de5ef.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d4c960eb2f28855599fce2dc505cd53e/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-20/s540x810/abb1f52d3420e6ed526e3df78fdedb4dc8bfe853.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c65b0ae15e9a4e136b06f1a59fdc85e4/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-de/s540x810/b4b76113dc624af8020c61b54f8e9409197cd3cb.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f869ae354ebe0c34fb4d22652ec91ecb/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-f4/s540x810/41eea41f638471d0326e324b721e1d551c7e3b06.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f8ff1a625be3bb068b140b819d63598e/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-69/s540x810/5b7b19a9e8a87a2578a81588cfcb36aae1fbba11.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f93aa8f3f30d496c5374591551a44398/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-ce/s540x810/b7b08edd15878b3180f00d1e4504abaeb9a18113.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9fe0e610915802752a17ba0ab56a5035/c0f29c4b91a6bce0-05/s540x810/a

Marlon Brando’s smoldering look in _[The Wild One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwB_Mrnwr_8)\n_ helped to cement the black double rider as the rebel uniform, just as the opening scene of _[Breakfast at Tiffany’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JfS90u-1g8)\n_ refashioned the black, sheath evening dress into a womenswear icon. In his 1985 book _[Elegance](https://rstyle.me/+QsAd-3oMNQFOM_5-3KJk-Q)\n_, Bruce Boyer calls these cinematic touchstones the “moments that signal or symbolize a shift in the old modus oprandi.” These scenes, as unimportant as they may seem, later become the film equivalents of the most memorable lyric in a song. And in being so, they change the ways we see clothing.\n\nBoyer traces the moment when tassel loafers became an acceptable form of business dress to a particular scene in the 1962 film _[That Touch of Mink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6Qvd0qT12M)\n_. The scene starts with Cary Grant, who plays the familiar international corporate head, walking into his wood-paneled office on Madison Avenue one average morning. “He’s wearing his familiar dark, impeccably cut business suit, white shirt, conservative tie, and black straight tip oxfords. He is the very glass of business fashion, the mold of form,” Boyer writes. Yet, upon settling in, Grant “removes his suit jacket and town shoes, and dons a discrete, but obviously very comfortable, lightweight cardigan and a pair of tassel loafers! Right there in the office!” In today’s business culture, where everyone wears jeans and sneakers, this story has a quaint ring to it. But as Boyer notes, this is just one of the many “less-than-earthshaking events that mark the road we have traveled.”\n\nA similar moment happened for the sweatshirt, that mass-manufactured item that has none of the rock ‘n roll cool of biker jackets or the blue-collar credibility of blue jeans. Yet, when Steve McQueen wore a dusty blue sweatshirt in the film _[The Great Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaFBFmJG-LI)\n,_ particularly in that scene when “The Cooler King” raced through the mountain trails and slid into a barbed-wire barrier, the garment attained a touch of cool. The sweatshirt is as iconic as every other notable American garment – blue jeans, black double riders, sack suits, penny loafers, and button-down collars – and it symbolizes the same independent American spirit. Much of that is thanks to McQueen (or, really, his stunt double, [Bud Ekins](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/arts/12ekins.html)\n, who did the hard work in that chase scene).\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/65402ab3f7879caf44d0e3ed17e0ecef/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-f0/s540x810/82b764bde558f09d57abdc8542f52eabc3bd64e1.jpg)\n\nBefore that cinematic moment, the unassuming sweatshirt was just a solution to a problem. During the early 20th century, sportspeople wore heavy woolen knits, often in grey, before and after training. These sweaters were itchy against bare skin, difficult to wash, slow to dry, and expensive to procure. This all changed in the 1920s, when the American brand Russell – founded by Benjamin Russell in Alexander City, Alabama in 1902 – refashioned something from their line of [women’s underwear called a union suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_suit)\n. The design was done at the behest the company founder’s son, Bernie, who was an avid football player at the University of Alabama. Bernie wanted something cheaper and more practical to wear while training, so he had his dad modify the company’s women’s union-suit top for him and his teammates. \n\nImagine how revolutionary this would sound today: a college boy asking his father to redesign a piece of women’s underwear for his male teammates to wear in the gym (to be fair, the underwear style at the time had also bled into men’s wardrobes, although Russell pulled the original template from their women’s line). The history of the sweatshirt is just one of the many examples of how gender norms have, in some ways, actually become stricter over time, ignoring the historical fluidity between the two aisles. Around the time of the sweatshirt’s introduction as an athletic garment, _Time Magazine_ printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys (girls were told to wear blue, boys were to wear pink – assignments that have switched). Before this, [little boys and girls wore frilly white dresses](https://dieworkwear.com/post/171641182254/comme-des-filles-like-girls)\n. Today, children’s clothing is highly gendered, sometimes disturbingly sexualized, partly because people worry about their kids growing up with the “wrong” gender identity (something dress historian Jo Paoletti covers in her book _[Pink and Blue](https://rstyle.me/+MfePsk8azLECgsDDoqex3w)\n_). Years ago, men were so worried about looking feminine, questions such as “can I wear a pink shirt” commonly cropped up on [StyleForum](https://www.styleforum.net/)\n. \n\nNonetheless, shortly after the sweatshirt was introduced, this remade women’s garment was distributed to four American college football teams, where it became an instant hit. Since then, the sweatshirt has been worn by professional and amateur athletes alike, across different sports, and on and off the field. Now, the plain and familiar sweatshirt is considered as much of an icon of masculinity as blue jeans and leather jackets. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/414687bc497a31a21c939630e8956146/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-dd/s540x810/e0c24451906bc91e5a194dfbcba6220f4b5ac7b3.jpg)\n\nThe sweatshirt didn’t reach its potential until the 1930s, however, when Abe and Bill Feinbloom — the two brothers who founded Knickerbocker Knitting Company, which today trades under the name Champion — found a way to print raised lettering on sturdy cotton knits. Soon, the sweatshirt wasn’t just a symbol of sport, but also personal identity. Printed messages allowed people to show their allegiance to specific clubs, teams, and companies. Culturally, the sweatshirt is everything: a useful garment you can wear, an inexpensive thing to produce, a cheap item to purchase, a marketing tool, a souvenir, and a symbol of identity. Add to that the allure of Steve McQueen, and you can see why the sweatshirt has attained such status.\n\nIt’s been over a decade since menswear was obsessed with all things Americana and workwear. And yet, sweatshirts continue to be one of the most useful items in my wardrobe. They’re to Americana and workwear what Shetland sweaters are to Ivy and trad. You can wear them with leather jackets, chore coats, denim truckers, offbeat Japanese workwear, and even a bit of contemporary casual. They serve as a useful background to an outfit, can be machine-washed, and look better with age. When I don’t have time to iron a shirt, I’ll often throw on a sweatshirt because it’s comfortable and easy to wear. I find heathered grey is the most useful color, distantly followed by stone, dusty charcoal, muted blue, and olive. \n\nIf you have the scratch and love vintage Americana, it would be hard to beat one of the high-end Japanese-made sweatshirts from companies such as [Buzz Rickson](https://www.selfedge.com/buzz-rickson?category_id=63)\n, [The Real McCoys](https://standardandstrange.com/collections/the-real-mccoys-knitwear)\n, and [Studio D’Artisan](https://www.selfedge.com/studio-dartisan?category_id=63)\n. They’re made on old world loopwheel machines, which are slow and inefficient by modern manufacturing standards, but put less tension on the threads while knitting. It’s said this produces a better garment. Loopwheel knits are a little closer to the mid-century originals and are highly sought after by clothing collectors. I find these Japanese-made knits are stout without being suffocatingly thick. Their looser, slightly rounded bodies look more casual than streamlined sweatshirts. And they age impressively well. My [Buzz Rickson sweatshirt](https://www.selfedge.com/buzz-rickson?product_id=1966&category_id=63)\n has kept its shape, despite repeated washings over the last seven years. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/89c34715da520339d25a37c6e60797e1/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-da/s540x810/d929babff8c60a3a863e0c4a9fae555ad118c0e6.jpg)\n\nI’ve also been impressed with the looser, more fashion-forward sweatshirts from [Chimala](https://rstyle.me/+kJpoBz2S1aSqEb_w63dCRQ)\n and [John Elliott.](https://rstyle.me/+vJ8OsZ6ZafpIo9yG5OcMiA)\n They’re wider and slightly cropped, which gives them a unique silhouette ([Alexander Wang](https://rstyle.me/+ZjG_Zr0ORuOIm71uS6rpew)\n does something similar, but I find the material is less dense). Both companies offer them in a variety of interesting finishes. [I bought this one from John Elliott this season](https://rstyle.me/+Fs8G87UyjKwXzE3yF9AqWQ)\n, and despite being skeptical — perhaps even snobbishly adverse — to the brand’s hype, this sweatshirt is pretty good. The sun-faded blue color is perfect with blue jeans, but can also be worn with olive fatigues, black denim, and tan workwear chinos.\n\nChampion is known for their reverse-weave sweatshirts, which means the light ribbing runs horizontally across the body, rather than vertically up it. It’s said this helps minimize shrinking, no matter how many times the garment is washed, although I haven’t had any issues with shrinkage with other sweatshirts (_[shrinkage!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DoARSlv-HU)\n_). Modern Champion sweatshirts aren’t quite up to the standards of their extra beefy 1980s classics, [but their collaboration with Todd Synder is genuinely good](https://rstyle.me/+mgXOWfLx0OmOOQ3D5reseQ)\n. My friend Pete also vouches for [Pennsylvania’s Camber label](https://putthison.com/the-strength-of-knit-knowledge-camber-ive-heard/)\n. “Camber has been the label-under-the-label for a lot of streetwear brands, including Bape offshoot Very Ape, Futura stuff, and, rumor has it, Engineered Garments Workaday,” Pete writes. Prices are impressive at just $65, but you have to love the slightly roomier fit. [The French boutique Beige has fit pics](https://www.beige-habilleur.com/en/61_camber-usa?orderby=date_upd&orderway=DESC&p=2)\n. \n\nOther great companies include [Levi’s Vintage Clothing](https://rstyle.me/+cENbOqXuixeCIomhyHBbjg)\n, [3sixteen](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/fleece)\n, [Sunspel](https://rstyle.me/+mXY1GM2vcHhG5ORejpu8Iw)\n, [Reigning Champ](https://rstyle.me/+jHIVHIlqWSB7IpgiThAZnA)\n, [Battenwear](https://battenwear.com/collections/sweats-tees)\n, [RRL](https://rstyle.me/+PShD7i70QJSDnrN-ggOEEg)\n, [Velva Sheen](https://www.supplyandadvise.com/collections/velva-sheen)\n, [Lady White Company](https://ladywhiteco.com/product-category/sweatshirts/)\n, [Columbiaknit](http://usa-wear.com/ostore/index.php?route=product/category&path=199)\n, [TSPTR](https://tsptr.com/collections/sweatshirts)\n, and [Merz b Schwanen](https://bit.ly/2J5J1tO)\n. [Markkt](https://www.marrkt.com/collections/new-arrivals)\n, the online marketplace for secondhand workwear, is worth a look if you want one of those Japanese knits for a little cheaper. And there are vintage shops such as [Wooden Sleepers](https://wooden-sleepers.com/collections/sweatshirts)\n, where you can get something with cool provenance and a rare, faded-out print. As usual, [it’s worth digging around Etsy](https://rstyle.me/+sZDf8MgD7kHICZUHDNH6Eg)\n. \n\nLastly, don’t discount cheaper, everyday brands such as [J. Crew](https://rstyle.me/+JmbC2yhh1BxUqJL983Wupg)\n. I find mall-bought sweatshirts are a little more likely to lose their shape – particular around the ribbed hem, which means the sweatshirt will “hang” on you, rather than create a tautly knit, rounded shape – but you can always throw them into the wash and then dryer. That should snap the garment back into its original form. The color may dull from being in the dryer so often, but … it’s a sweatshirt. Faded is better. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d1fbcc8c3a67c64110d949e28ef9ce8/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-a5/s540x810/67f2f424792fe590cd121b872c10d5083ce884e4.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a8638e32437f2fafe9ba4e6c83d67b6e/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-f2/s540x810/523a843322ecb911d8081a633335a9f94bc9e62f.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/85ee42ca5e6c250466f006ebc0f309bc/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-67/s540x810/93fecd19cc2259834943a70e486b9c7fd8b942f4.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cd852a6cc878ccf13ade96c58174294a/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-57/s540x810/920c557dbf89ef6d4e292b92609153936f99f445.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1a4c46afeb94b89a276d6b1b7dcffe82/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-a8/s540x810/e4b596e002b157eb8095b75e0f5d7269a1c798ed.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f313245362988d02189dccfa714e6592/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-0e/s540x810/bdffa87e2b30d78a256a4fe53a08bff017dbb439.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fcd09bc923f29556f290fe4dabd16bbe/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-df/s540x810/a1d6821d73807adb547baed1e46108ce11656055.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b51ac1efcfbc86821e3601a3b0d19ee/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-f7/s540x810/5fd4ddd35e41efcb96626174f627b5516bdd871a.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/156ca556dc1baf676a750e1e3053d310/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-78/s540x810/96772af72c2762f9f54fc29fff036e6d8ccd02c7.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/19781e1db9143ef671d67cb1537da501/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-a3/s540x810/14298666840ccdacfcfa751bd5bb3eac6a084f6d.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0e29206dff1fbd04d09ececa18108f8/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-0e/s540x810/8db5a4303f28947eac3afb8b67919f5361beb9e1.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef9fa3ef25bae5dc77c8dd6b242bc105/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-ff/s540x810/b4b1df1115b4ea630dc29b421fc25f1214aad756.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/60713326878b30841ad6e02f189a13e4/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-24/s540x810/f0578a57316f25e628da1e92dd0c467c45c681eb.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c6ca0fd22eb63c9e10d7d1a2e1703d89/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-8a/s540x810/c623f7857d8fdef1a9cfb2b7557b30a277d5df70.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ca36b7d2981412fd2f68587f8e049385/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-0c/s540x810/b7ec66aa5216b5b4a69ace5bb1812d49d134c6b3.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/674bbd2fbae490a2a2915a142c81e556/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-0a/s540x810/054cdd684b64b25b68a460b6fd5ed3b26a9b81b3.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/13d64825a77868477de5ed2aafd258e3/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-23/s540x810/7fd314024b2ea4587d7bf3e8e16a388b64f52e66.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d448a7bad13b815b66a6cbeb44fb70a5/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-0f/s540x810/aa72fd395f9cac33960f6213dc3237acbd843b02.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f4ff08c153e7edd11a595a8b04ce686b/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-b4/s540x810/e03712c0b60bc4a274fd0b7c378eacbb39cac084.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f926d2f34c192c54c29bd1b1383eed8a/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-ec/s540x810/3f069ada824b76ed3314ab5f20b2fc10500c9d6e.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3b3c0ca2aa13ee5203182730796c176/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-93/s540x810/229fd86ae7205ccb6d6d449addb5fa912668011a.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/120f510d56b1892984c65639fb3338f0/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-12/s540x810/a3c23a71b76feabfdbf0daafcf937be6ac8db112.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e882724af245aadeed017655654334f3/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-09/s540x810/3f559ca562a33db48984f1774993ff7430a191ba.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/040919d59c38c67b19169bf60057d573/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-d6/s540x810/12542f03c58262347b8c608e0c59efa9ee78025b.png)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e77315de108a713a605d1a396754ebc4/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-bf/s540x810/172067f8277782b70d46954c4b079a6a78ca904d.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8bf3e145dfdc508e5c2245d2a5dd3c90/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-54/s540x810/07cb7c79703b56dee89f4b37c6f5e0af3e20acc3.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a979e8033efb48075537f808d0469fff/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-57/s540x810/19174c7f65f86269a88fbadb2d409f086b831bf4.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b9ed67f17259e87282746ab9386898e/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-15/s540x810/3157fa28aaee4a27574ddc48758af0897c5669f5.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/93146fb11a482f8710ad36b7005b0145/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-ac/s540x810/52a774820952ae0eb084c2b9397e98acae1a444a.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4efee7a9065002729fc12927686a2033/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-5d/s540x810/fed1afce0f047fffb9aba2e5c772eb17c1285bca.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73e11c5d459174d59c1f19e8e37d869d/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-66/s540x810/1f0cbad289985097ddde3f158aa34176bd599495.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/143c295e3c595f31f6c72d76f1b6726c/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-d7/s540x810/e4a2f4fcd000be56a3a2d09f70ea77ada866d3f0.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fba3fab1dde6309e2b00b0ed3dbb7090/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-73/s540x810/019c2cea2520b893768c1b9b8b4ce07102e2c672.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9482d0c8d4eb2661f0d2c81e7964ab8a/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-42/s540x810/83669

fashion writers focus on the runway, actual fashion moments often happen on film. Marlon Brando’s smoldering look in _[The Wild One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwB_Mrnwr_8)\n_ helped to cement the black double rider as the rebel uniform, just as the opening scene of _[Breakfast at Tiffany’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JfS90u-1g8)\n_ refashioned the black, sheath evening dress into a womenswear icon. In his 1985 book _[Elegance](https://rstyle.me/+QsAd-3oMNQFOM_5-3KJk-Q)\n_, Bruce Boyer calls these cinematic touchstones the “moments that signal or symbolize a shift in the old modus oprandi.” These scenes, as unimportant as they may seem, later become the film equivalents of the most memorable lyric in a song. And in being so, they change the ways we see clothing.\n\nBoyer traces the moment when tassel loafers became an acceptable form of business dress to a particular scene in the 1962 film _[That Touch of Mink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6Qvd0qT12M)\n_. The scene starts with Cary Grant, who plays the familiar international corporate head, walking into his wood-paneled office on Madison Avenue one average morning. “He’s wearing his familiar dark, impeccably cut business suit, white shirt, conservative tie, and black straight tip oxfords. He is the very glass of business fashion, the mold of form,” Boyer writes. Yet, upon settling in, Grant “removes his suit jacket and town shoes, and dons a discrete, but obviously very comfortable, lightweight cardigan and a pair of tassel loafers! Right there in the office!” In today’s business culture, where everyone wears jeans and sneakers, this story has a quaint ring to it. But as Boyer notes, this is just one of the many “less-than-earthshaking events that mark the road we have traveled.”\n\nA similar moment happened for the sweatshirt, that mass-manufactured item that has none of the rock ‘n roll cool of biker jackets or the blue-collar credibility of blue jeans. Yet, when Steve McQueen wore a dusty blue sweatshirt in the film _[The Great Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaFBFmJG-LI)\n,_ particularly in that scene when “The Cooler King” raced through the mountain trails and slid into a barbed-wire barrier, the garment attained a touch of cool. The sweatshirt is as iconic as every other notable American garment – blue jeans, black double riders, sack suits, penny loafers, and button-down collars – and it symbolizes the same independent American spirit. Much of that is thanks to McQueen (or, really, his stunt double, [Bud Ekins](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/arts/12ekins.html)\n, who did the hard work in that chase scene).\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/65402ab3f7879caf44d0e3ed17e0ecef/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-f0/s540x810/82b764bde558f09d57abdc8542f52eabc3bd64e1.jpg)\n\nBefore that cinematic moment, the unassuming sweatshirt was just a solution to a problem. During the early 20th century, sportspeople wore heavy woolen knits, often in grey, before and after training. These sweaters were itchy against bare skin, difficult to wash, slow to dry, and expensive to procure. This all changed in the 1920s, when the American brand Russell – founded by Benjamin Russell in Alexander City, Alabama in 1902 – refashioned something from their line of [women’s underwear called a union suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_suit)\n. The design was done at the behest the company founder’s son, Bernie, who was an avid football player at the University of Alabama. Bernie wanted something cheaper and more practical to wear while training, so he had his dad modify the company’s women’s union-suit top for him and his teammates. \n\nImagine how revolutionary this would sound today: a college boy asking his father to redesign a piece of women’s underwear for his male teammates to wear in the gym (to be fair, the underwear style at the time had also bled into men’s wardrobes, although Russell pulled the original template from their women’s line). The history of the sweatshirt is just one of the many examples of how gender norms have, in some ways, actually become stricter over time, ignoring the historical fluidity between the two aisles. Around the time of the sweatshirt’s introduction as an athletic garment, _Time Magazine_ printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys (girls were told to wear blue, boys were to wear pink – assignments that have switched). Before this, [little boys and girls wore frilly white dresses](https://dieworkwear.com/post/171641182254/comme-des-filles-like-girls)\n. Today, children’s clothing is highly gendered, sometimes disturbingly sexualized, partly because people worry about their kids growing up with the “wrong” gender identity (something dress historian Jo Paoletti covers in her book _[Pink and Blue](https://rstyle.me/+MfePsk8azLECgsDDoqex3w)\n_). Years ago, men were so worried about looking feminine, questions such as “can I wear a pink shirt” commonly cropped up on [StyleForum](https://www.styleforum.net/)\n. \n\nNonetheless, shortly after the sweatshirt was introduced, this remade women’s garment was distributed to four American college football teams, where it became an instant hit. Since then, the sweatshirt has been worn by professional and amateur athletes alike, across different sports, and on and off the field. Now, the plain and familiar sweatshirt is considered as much of an icon of masculinity as blue jeans and leather jackets. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/414687bc497a31a21c939630e8956146/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-dd/s540x810/e0c24451906bc91e5a194dfbcba6220f4b5ac7b3.jpg)\n\nThe sweatshirt didn’t reach its potential until the 1930s, however, when Abe and Bill Feinbloom — the two brothers who founded Knickerbocker Knitting Company, which today trades under the name Champion — found a way to print raised lettering on sturdy cotton knits. Soon, the sweatshirt wasn’t just a symbol of sport, but also personal identity. Printed messages allowed people to show their allegiance to specific clubs, teams, and companies. Culturally, the sweatshirt is everything: a useful garment you can wear, an inexpensive thing to produce, a cheap item to purchase, a marketing tool, a souvenir, and a symbol of identity. Add to that the allure of Steve McQueen, and you can see why the sweatshirt has attained such status.\n\nIt’s been over a decade since menswear was obsessed with all things Americana and workwear. And yet, sweatshirts continue to be one of the most useful items in my wardrobe. They’re to Americana and workwear what Shetland sweaters are to Ivy and trad. You can wear them with leather jackets, chore coats, denim truckers, offbeat Japanese workwear, and even a bit of contemporary casual. They serve as a useful background to an outfit, can be machine-washed, and look better with age. When I don’t have time to iron a shirt, I’ll often throw on a sweatshirt because it’s comfortable and easy to wear. I find heathered grey is the most useful color, distantly followed by stone, dusty charcoal, muted blue, and olive. \n\nIf you have the scratch and love vintage Americana, it would be hard to beat one of the high-end Japanese-made sweatshirts from companies such as [Buzz Rickson](https://www.selfedge.com/buzz-rickson?category_id=63)\n, [The Real McCoys](https://standardandstrange.com/collections/the-real-mccoys-knitwear)\n, and [Studio D’Artisan](https://www.selfedge.com/studio-dartisan?category_id=63)\n. They’re made on old world loopwheel machines, which are slow and inefficient by modern manufacturing standards, but put less tension on the threads while knitting. It’s said this produces a better garment. Loopwheel knits are a little closer to the mid-century originals and are highly sought after by clothing collectors. I find these Japanese-made knits are stout without being suffocatingly thick. Their looser, slightly rounded bodies look more casual than streamlined sweatshirts. And they age impressively well. My [Buzz Rickson sweatshirt](https://www.selfedge.com/buzz-rickson?product_id=1966&category_id=63)\n has kept its shape, despite repeated washings over the last seven years. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/89c34715da520339d25a37c6e60797e1/b0a88b67ba6d76a1-da/s540x810/d929babff8c60a3a863e0c4a9fae555ad118c0e6.jpg)\n\nI’ve also been impressed with the looser, more fashion-forward sweatshirts from [Chimala](https://rstyle.me/+kJpoBz2S1aSqEb_w63dCRQ)\n and [John Elliott.](https://rstyle.me/+vJ8OsZ6ZafpIo9yG5OcMiA)\n They’re wider and slightly cropped, which gives them a unique silhouette ([Alexander Wang](https://rstyle.me/+ZjG_Zr0ORuOIm71uS6rpew)\n does something similar, but I find the material is less dense). Both companies offer them in a variety of interesting finishes. [I bought this one from John Elliott this season](https://rstyle.me/+Fs8G87UyjKwXzE3yF9AqWQ)\n, and despite being skeptical — perhaps even snobbishly adverse — to the brand’s hype, this sweatshirt is pretty good. The sun-faded blue color is perfect with blue jeans, but can also be worn with olive fatigues, black denim, and tan workwear chinos.\n\nChampion is known for their reverse-weave sweatshirts, which means the light ribbing runs horizontally across the body, rather than vertically up it. It’s said this helps minimize shrinking, no matter how many times the garment is washed, although I haven’t had any issues with shrinkage with other sweatshirts (_[shrinkage!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DoARSlv-HU)\n_). Modern Champion sweatshirts aren’t quite up to the standards of their extra beefy 1980s classics, [but their collaboration with Todd Synder is genuinely good](https://rstyle.me/+mgXOWfLx0OmOOQ3D5reseQ)\n. My friend Pete also vouches for [Pennsylvania’s Camber label](https://putthison.com/the-strength-of-knit-knowledge-camber-ive-heard/)\n. “Camber has been the label-under-the-label for a lot of streetwear brands, including Bape offshoot Very Ape, Futura stuff, and, rumor has it, Engineered Garments Workaday,” Pete writes. Prices are impressive at just $65, but you have to love the slightly roomier fit. [The French boutique Beige has fit pics](https://www.beige-habilleur.com/en/61_camber-usa?orderby=date_upd&orderway=DESC&p=2)\n. \n\nOther great companies include [Levi’s Vintage Clothing](https://rstyle.me/+cENbOqXuixeCIomhyHBbjg)\n, [3sixteen](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/fleece)\n, [Sunspel](https://rstyle.me/+mXY1GM2vcHhG5ORejpu8Iw)\n, [Reigning Champ](https://rstyle.me/+jHIVHIlqWSB7IpgiThAZnA)\n, [Battenwear](https://battenwear.com/collections/sweats-tees)\n, [RRL](https://rstyle.me/+PShD7i70QJSDnrN-ggOEEg)\n, [Velva Sheen](https://www.supplyandadvise.com/collections/velva-sheen)\n, [Lady White Company](https://ladywhiteco.com/product-category/sweatshirts/)\n, [Columbiaknit](http://usa-wear.com/ostore/index.php?route=product/category&path=199)\n, [TSPTR](https://tsptr.com/collections/sweatshirts)\n, and [Merz b Schwanen](https://bit.ly/2J5J1tO)\n. [Markkt](https://www.marrkt.com/collections/new-arrivals)\n, the online marketplace for secondhand workwear, is worth a look if you want one of those Japanese knits for a little cheaper. And there are vintage shops such as [Wooden Sleepers](https://wooden-sleepers.com/collections/sweatshirts)\n, where you can get something with cool provenance and a rare, faded-out print. As usual, [it’s worth digging around Etsy](https://rstyle.me/+sZDf8MgD7kHICZUHDNH6Eg)\n. \n\nLastly, don’t discount cheaper, everyday brands such as [J. Crew](https://rstyle.me/+JmbC2yhh1BxUqJL983Wupg)\n. I find mall-bought sweatshirts are a little more likely to lose their shape – particular around the ribbed hem, which means the sweatshirt will “hang” on you, rather than create a tautly knit, rounded shape – but you can always throw them into the wash and then dryer. That should snap the garment back into its original form. The color may dull from being in the dryer so often, but … it’s a sweatshirt.

The third big one started this morning: [No Man Walks Alone](https://bit.ly/2ICMS1A)\n, where you can find select items discounted by as much as 40% off. Their sale is one of my favorites for two reasons. The first is that I get to post a photo of the shop’s founder, Greg Lellouche, and note that he is, in fact, walking alone. The second is the shop’s selection. While No Man Walks Alone is a sponsor on this site, they’re also one of my favorite online retailers. Along with some excellent tailoring, they also carry Japanese workwear, contemporary casual, and a bit of the avant-garde.\n\nThe selection here is big, but not massive. It’s reasonably easy to scroll through the entire sale selection to see if there’s anything you want, but No Man Walks Alone also has filters on their site so you can narrow in on sizes, colors, and brands. Some of my favorite makers here include Sartoria Formosa, Drake’s, and Kaptain Sunshine. If you’re looking for highlights, here are ten things that I think are notable.\n\n**[Valstar’s Plaid Wool-Alpaca Topcoat](https://bit.ly/2RB48a5)\n**\n\n[Valstar is mostly known for their Valstarino](https://bit.ly/2xo210h)\n, which is a citified take on the American A-1 bomber. The style is popular with guys who usually wear suits and sport coats because it’s a little dressy and can be paired with tailored trousers. Those jackets are genuinely great, [but I’ve been mostly impressed with this wool-alpaca topcoat](https://bit.ly/2RB48a5)\n. The scale of the plaid, while bold, helps add visual interest to plain-colored ensembles. Greg can be seen above wearing it with a tan flannel suit. I think the style would work equally well with blue jeans, a textured sweater, and some brown suede chukkas. You can see other outfit combinations on NMWA’s site if you scroll down on the product page.  \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d7d1718d0051c4bbe992d0397fa053a/tumblr_inline_ptp5imKhDA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**Everything from Sartoria Formosa**](https://bit.ly/2W0Bqkw)\n\nSartoria Formosa is a small, bespoke tailoring workshop in Naples, located in a gated courtyard and just a stone’s throw away from E.G. Cappelli. They’re famous for having dressed some of Italy’s most stylish leading actors during the 1950s and ‘60s. The workshop still mostly does bespoke, but they also make a small ready-to-wear line for NMWA (all made to bespoke standards, but with ready-to-wear patterns). The cut is distinctively Neapolitan. It has a soft shoulder line, soft chest, and quarters that sweep back towards the hips. Unlike many ready-to-wear Italian brands, however, the chest is a fuller and the shoulder line extended, which I think looks more flattering on most men (the cut gives the illusion of a V-shaped figure). This season, I love their [olive cotton suit](https://bit.ly/2NePMh1)\n and [olive checked sport coat](https://bit.ly/2Ll9mpl)\n. NMWA also has [one size left for the “summer tweed”](https://bit.ly/2FzgqLp)\n I ran a couple of years ago. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/97b3c2b582125bd711b5bcd9f1d2eb1e/tumblr_inline_ptp5g1OHlD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**Blurhms “Girl in Glasses” Graphic Tee**](https://bit.ly/2X9s3mW)\n\nEven on sale, it’s hard to justify a t-shirt that costs over $100. That said, I bought one of Blurhms’ graphic tees this season and was impressed with the combed cotton and high-gauge knit. It’s soft and comfy, noticeably higher-end than your average tee, and the photographic prints pair well with contemporary casualwear. I’ve been wearing mine with a [black Margiela five-zip](https://rstyle.me/+SBhRVV9z0MvLRTTrS9Sq0A)\n. This version, which features a woman looking off into the sunset, has warmer colors that I think suits summer. Wear it with contemporary casualwear, denim trucker jackets, or olive green milsurp jackets.  \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f852ac2c3bf816cc18506e90c5e4af68/tumblr_inline_ptp5q475QP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**Everything Eidos**](https://bit.ly/2GmyGZi)\n\nAntonio Ciongoli is no longer designing for Eidos, but a small selection of his patterns, cuts, and styles are available at No Man Walks Alone for one last season. [I really like the two tonal seersucker suits](https://bit.ly/2GmyGZi)\n this spring, which are available in olive green and a narrower striped tan. Traditional seersucker, in its blue-and-white color combination, can conjure up old-time-y ideas of Southern gentility — men chomping on fat cigars and cucumber sandwiches, swilling their mint juleps while attending lawn parties. I think the style has a certain charm, but if it feels too traditional for you, these have all the cool-wearing effect of seersucker in more modern form. I also love the tan linen suit, pictured above. [The suit jacket can be worn on its own](https://bit.ly/2ZKR4BS)\n as a sport coat with blue jeans or tailored trousers, [while the pants](https://bit.ly/2KDS9YM)\n can be worn with navy, tropical wool sport coats. Casual suits such as this one are great because it feels like you’re getting a three-for-one. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d379ad6937396aec11b1850bf346978/tumblr_inline_ptp7luJwzV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**G. Inglese Bold Striped Shirt**](https://bit.ly/2YdVcdn)\n\nI mostly rely on light-blue dress shirts for simplicity, but over the last year, I’ve started to appreciate how good a bolder striped shirt can look underneath a plainer suit or sport coat. A bold shirt adds visual interest; it’s cheery and fun; it can substitute for a tie. There are a ton of places to buy one this season, [but I’ve been particularly impressed with this one from G. Inglese](https://bit.ly/2YdVcdn)\n. Along with the amount of handwork (e.g., hand-attached collar and sleeves, and well as handsewn details), the one-piece collar allows the back of the placket to show all the stripes pointing in one direction. The combination of blue, white, and green stripes would look terrific under almost any kind of summer tailoring.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dff806d4864695254d86e7914e652b68/tumblr_inline_ptp5xpNf7E1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**Everything Drake’s**](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=748949&u=1156177&m=60146&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fnomanwalksalone%2Ecom%2Fmakers%2Fdrake%5F039%5Fs&afftrack=)\n\nIt’s hard to go wrong with any of Drake’s pocket squares. They typically come in distinctive, playful patterns, which makes them look better than cheaper pocket squares produced from necktie silks or cotton shirtings. [This one comes in a bold, geometric design in rust and mustard](https://bit.ly/2XA66gk)\n. I have a similar pocket square that I often wear without a necktie. The colors add a touch of summer to plain, navy sport coats. They also go great with casual tailoring, such as suits in olive cotton, tan gabardine, and tobacco linen. The cotton-modal blend here feels a little silky and delicate — perfect for the season.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f4757db432a928ac18371e632f867df/tumblr_inline_ptp60bdLMu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**Fujito Wide Slacks**](https://bit.ly/31tF8pX)\n\n[Fujito’s wide slacks](https://bit.ly/31tF8pX)\n aren’t flattering by traditional standards, but they’re very cool. They’re essentially an upgraded version of Dickies without the cheap, poly-blend sheen. They have a wide, carrot cut with a roomy top-block that gently tapers down. I think of them as 1990s skate pants. They have a rugged feel that pairs well with Americana and workwear, but also an interesting silhouette that pushes them closer to streetwear. Additionally, the metal snap-buttons along the fly make these feel extra sturdy. I like how this charcoal cotton version looks with blue denim trucker jackets. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e996bae1da9e2a782943d12d67aae47e/tumblr_inline_ptp69vCI2z1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**Kaptain Sunshine Gurkha Trousers**](https://bit.ly/2wwQ87w)\n\nGurkha trousers come from when the British occupied North Africa and India – a time that left a terrible political legacy, but nevertheless continues to inspire in terms of style. They’re typically high waisted, made from heavy drill cotton, and defined by their unique belting system. That weird rigging once allowed British officers to cinch their trousers as they lost weight. I love how they draw to mind all those beautiful safari images in old Banana Republic catalogs, before Banana Republic was bought out by The Gap. [Kaptain Sunshine’s version](https://bit.ly/2wwQ87w)\n comes with a slightly more relaxed leg line, which I think suits the belting system, and can be worn with Breton pullovers, chambray work shirts, or chunky fisherman knits (as shown on [penanceroyaltea above](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv5f2LVgeXn/)\n). For a bit of added style, you can let the elongated belt hang down a little, as shown the product photos. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/76eda2299a9dc93952834b037520634d/tumblr_inline_ptp6sbAck51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**Tony Shirtmakers Fern Shirt**](https://bit.ly/2Ycs8Tq)\n\n[I love the backstory of this hand-printed shirt](https://bit.ly/2Ycs8Tq)\n. It was designed in collaboration with graphic designer Bang Tran, an avid gardener and outdoors enthusiast. “I worked briefly for an herbarium, preserving plants through pressing, and I thought prints of real pressed plants would be the ideal medium to infuse the shirt with the Aloha spirit,” he wrote. “Flowers are a little too delicate to use in this way, and I wanted to avoid cliched florals anyway. Ultimately, I decided on a theme of ancient plants that have been around longer than humans: ferns, magnolias, and ginkgos. With that in mind, I ended up hiking around two state parks to collect specimens for the design.”\n\nAfter gathering a sampling of different leaves, Bang covered them with India ink using a sponge, then pressed them against cardstock. He then digitally rendered them and made mock-ups of what they might look like on a shirt. Tony at Tony Shirtmakers ultimately went with the netted chain fern design, which he then hand-printed onto taupe linen using silk screens. I mostly like the shirt because it feels topical without being literal, and has a gardening vibe that goes well with workwear. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0f96cb0bbb95c55dc612b32bca44482/tumblr_inline_ptp71qApAU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**[Rota Mid-Gray Trousers](https://bit.ly/2YbmXmB)\n**\n\nGrey trousers are the first pants you should buy, and probably the second and third, as well. Virtually every sport coat can be paired with grey trousers, and if you come across one that can’t, you might want to reconsider buying it. They’re the trouser equivalent of navy sport coats and light blue dress shirts – the go-to you can reach for again and again. Rota’s are particularly nice. They’re more expensive than trousers made by Hertling, such as the ones sold through [Dapper Classics](https://dapperclassics.com/collections/trousers)\n, but they come with a slightly higher rise. No Man Walks Alone stocks them in every fabric imaginable, [but the mid-gray, tropical wool pair](https://bit.ly/2YbmXmB)\n pictured above is a summer staple, if there ever was one. \n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/27f7b9c98f5954df75a48aa1b959bc7e/tumblr_inline_ptp6owHIu41qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nIt’s that time of year when I post a spat of seasonal sales. The third big one started this morning: [No Man Walks Alone](https://bit.ly/2ICMS1A)\n, where you can find select items discounted by as much as 40% off. Their sale is one of my favorites for two reasons. The first is that I get to post a photo of the shop’s founder, Greg Lellouche, and note that he is, in fact, walking alone. The second is the shop’s selection. While No Man Walks Alone is a sponsor on this site, they’re also one of my favorite online retailers. Along with some excellent tailoring, they also carry Japanese workwear, contemporary casual, and a bit of the avant-garde.\n\nThe selection here is big, but not massive. It’s reasonably easy to scroll through the entire sale selection to see if there’s anything you want, but No Man Walks Alone also has filters on their site so you can narrow in on sizes, colors, and brands. Some of my favorite makers here include Sartoria Formosa, Drake’s, and Kaptain Sunshine. If you’re looking for highlights, here are ten things that I think are notable.\n\n**[Valstar’s Plaid Wool-Alpaca Topcoat](https://bit.ly/2RB48a5)\n**\n\n[Valstar is mostly known for their Valstarino](https://bit.ly/2xo210h)\n, which is a citified take on the American A-1 bomber. The style is popular with guys who usually wear suits and sport coats because it’s a little dressy and can be paired with tailored trousers. Those jackets are genuinely great, [but I’ve been mostly impressed with this wool-alpaca topcoat](https://bit.ly/2RB48a5)\n. The scale of the plaid, while bold, helps add visual interest to plain-colored ensembles. Greg can be seen above wearing it with a tan flannel suit. I think the style would work equally well with blue jeans, a textured sweater, and some brown suede chukkas. You can see other outfit combinations on NMWA’s site if you scroll down on the product page.  \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d7d1718d0051c4bbe992d0397fa053a/tumblr_inline_ptp5imKhDA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**Everything from Sartoria Formosa**](https://bit.ly/2W0Bqkw)\n\nSartoria Formosa is a small, bespoke tailoring workshop in Naples, located in a gated courtyard and just a stone’s throw away from E.G. Cappelli. They’re famous for having dressed some of Italy’s most stylish leading actors during the 1950s and ‘60s. The workshop still mostly does bespoke, but they also make a small ready-to-wear line for NMWA (all made to bespoke standards, but with ready-to-wear patterns). The cut is distinctively Neapolitan. It has a soft shoulder line, soft chest, and quarters that sweep back towards the hips. Unlike many ready-to-wear Italian brands, however, the chest is a fuller and the shoulder line extended, which I think looks more flattering on most men (the cut gives the illusion of a V-shaped figure). This season, I love their [olive cotton suit](https://bit.ly/2NePMh1)\n and [olive checked sport coat](https://bit.ly/2Ll9mpl)\n. NMWA also has [one size left for the “summer tweed”](https://bit.ly/2FzgqLp)\n I ran a couple of years ago. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/97b3c2b582125bd711b5bcd9f1d2eb1e/tumblr_inline_ptp5g1OHlD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**Blurhms “Girl in Glasses” Graphic Tee**](https://bit.ly/2X9s3mW)\n\nEven on sale, it’s hard to justify a t-shirt that costs over $100. That said, I bought one of Blurhms’ graphic tees this season and was impressed with the combed cotton and high-gauge knit. It’s soft and comfy, noticeably higher-end than your average tee, and the photographic prints pair well with contemporary casualwear. I’ve been wearing mine with a [black Margiela five-zip](https://rstyle.me/+SBhRVV9z0MvLRTTrS9Sq0A)\n. This version, which features a woman looking off into the sunset, has warmer colors that I think suits summer. Wear it with contemporary casualwear, denim trucker jackets, or olive green milsurp jackets.  \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f852ac2c3bf816cc18506e90c5e4af68/tumblr_inline_ptp5q475QP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**Everything Eidos**](https://bit.ly/2GmyGZi)\n\nAntonio Ciongoli is no longer designing for Eidos, but a small selection of his patterns, cuts, and styles are available at No Man Walks Alone for one last season. [I really like the two tonal seersucker suits](https://bit.ly/2GmyGZi)\n this spring, which are available in olive green and a narrower striped tan. Traditional seersucker, in its blue-and-white color combination, can conjure up old-time-y ideas of Southern gentility — men chomping on fat cigars and cucumber sandwiches, swilling their mint juleps while attending lawn parties. I think the style has a certain charm, but if it feels too traditional for you, these have all the cool-wearing effect of seersucker in more modern form. I also love the tan linen suit, pictured above. [The suit jacket can be worn on its own](https://bit.ly/2ZKR4BS)\n as a sport coat with blue jeans or tailored trousers, [while the pants](https://bit.ly/2KDS9YM)\n can be worn with navy, tropical wool sport coats. Casual suits such as this one are great because it feels like you’re getting a three-for-one. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d379ad6937396aec11b1850bf346978/tumblr_inline_ptp7luJwzV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**G.

The promotion only applies to items marked as “seasonal,” [which you can find neatly organized under this “sun shop” section](https://rstyle.me/+xw7op3CrFdvnfd63bsmfNw)\n. Don’t bother trying to apply the code to other full-priced products or already-marked down sale items – I tried and it doesn’t work.\n\nThe good news is that there’s actually a bit of good stuff in the “sun shop” section. There are some handsome camp-collar shirts from [Officine Generale](https://rstyle.me/+BQbwvwBIUbTlp3X-ipyyFQ)\n, [Gitman Vintage](https://rstyle.me/+TUd9FHyiY0ZYDNLT6C7J4w)\n, [AMI](https://rstyle.me/+fQbvAUcJQIXTs8DX4_bnYg)\n, and [Kapital](https://rstyle.me/+3KOCu8ynYJ2Fa0KpZLM6hA)\n. I have an older version of that Kapital shirt and wear it all the time with ranch jackets, chore coats, and even on its own with just jeans. Additionally, there are some summer-ready shorts from [Orlebar Brown](https://rstyle.me/+BcYmALJ2LSbxpeYrlqEltA)\n and [Officine Generale](https://rstyle.me/+hfc3L9hVZpk2XwM9GARkTA)\n; mid-length swim trunks from [Orlebar Brown](https://rstyle.me/+HAKKnwV4n0SJ_5i3tL_Lsw)\n; and my favorite chambray, which is made by [Chimala](https://rstyle.me/+_aADFgsZ15p3VXnGiBkfPA)\n. [This Rubinacci “Victory” pocket square](https://rstyle.me/+si1SowawToiqUUESjupP-w)\n has a cream-colored background that makes it useful in just about any tailored outfit, but also a bit of pattern that keeps it looking like the solid-colored, cream squares worn by prom DJs (no offense to prom DJs). \n\nI also bought a [vintage Lee’s 101-J trucker jacket](https://wooden-sleepers.com/collections/outerwear/products/vintage-lee-101j-denim-jacket)\n from Wooden Sleepers yesterday (it’s pictured below). The style was introduced in the 1930s and is known as the first slim-fit denim jacket. But more than provenance, I like the design for its slanted chest pockets, zig-zag stitching, and slightly cropped fit (they’re shorter than Levi’s truckers). You can find them on [Etsy for as little as $50](https://rstyle.me/+V9j26ZniOmzVXuE1ubtrSg)\n, but if you’re looking to splurge, [this Kapital trucker looks excellent](https://rstyle.me/+k4OCQcy7xnVCCLZWWQkCPA)\n.

The style looks like it would work well with tailoring or workwear, while the separate shoe compartments would let a germaphobe like me rest easy. Will Boehlke, formerly of A Suitable Wardrobe, [carries something similar from Ettinger](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuWlVDknpS8/)\n.\n\nFinally, the promotion includes a ton of loafers and slip-on styled shoes. See these tassel loafers from [Edward Green](https://rstyle.me/+0Yi76f-_H_23LO-xE4O8nA)\n, [black calf](https://rstyle.me/+U2SaRz6tdFeZvXR4CGDQCw)\n and [brown suede penny loafers](https://rstyle.me/+g_O3Wglxp-E8SHi9bP7vtA)\n from George Cleverly, [floppy unlined loafers](https://rstyle.me/+RSviT1C_ncjP3_q2lpWJAw)\n from Edward Green, and white canvas espadrilles from [Castañer](https://rstyle.me/+kuC5Xijp9ZL_z3WYolmBiQ)\n. Edward Green’s Picadilly loafers are my favorite loafers to wear with casual suits and sport coats. They’re terribly expensive (even on sale), but they have a beautiful, sleek shape without being cartoony. [Black is surprisingly nice](https://rstyle.me/+lr96-0g4FRf3HlWr0oB9Xw)\n with navy sport coats and grey trousers, although I don’t wear mine as much as [my dark brown pair](https://rstyle.me/+EQ3UGrB7aM1L-Woju4EQcw)\n. Hooman Majd can be seen wearing a tan pair of Piccadillys at the very top of this post.  \n\nNote, the 20% off promotion ends tonight.

Additionally, there are some summer-ready shorts from [Orlebar Brown](https://rstyle.me/+BcYmALJ2LSbxpeYrlqEltA)\n and [Officine Generale](https://rstyle.me/+hfc3L9hVZpk2XwM9GARkTA)\n; mid-length swim trunks from [Orlebar Brown](https://rstyle.me/+HAKKnwV4n0SJ_5i3tL_Lsw)\n; and my favorite chambray, which is made by [Chimala](https://rstyle.me/+_aADFgsZ15p3VXnGiBkfPA)\n. [This Rubinacci “Victory” pocket square](https://rstyle.me/+si1SowawToiqUUESjupP-w)\n has a cream-colored background that makes it useful in just about any tailored outfit, but also a bit of pattern that keeps it looking like the solid-colored, cream squares worn by prom DJs (no offense to prom DJs). \n\nI also bought a [vintage Lee’s 101-J trucker jacket](https://wooden-sleepers.com/collections/outerwear/products/vintage-lee-101j-denim-jacket)\n from Wooden Sleepers yesterday (it’s pictured below). The style was introduced in the 1930s and is known as the first slim-fit denim jacket. But more than provenance, I like the design for its slanted chest pockets, zig-zag stitching, and slightly cropped fit (they’re shorter than Levi’s truckers). You can find them on [Etsy for as little as $50](https://rstyle.me/+V9j26ZniOmzVXuE1ubtrSg)\n, but if you’re looking to splurge, [this Kapital trucker looks excellent](https://rstyle.me/+k4OCQcy7xnVCCLZWWQkCPA)\n. Note, Mr. Porter’s website recommends sizing up twice. \n\n![](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb92fa31927b63df6a4cef09b10585b1/tumblr_inline_ptgppmwana1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nMr. Porter also has some great luggage on sale, including some aluminum suitcases from [Fabbrica Pelletterie Milano](https://rstyle.me/+4yL3C9Srob7eXev-GnUntQ)\n and a black rolltop duffle bag from [Herschel Supply](https://rstyle.me/+rsEO5v2glrebkomOWsLefQ)\n. I’m tempted to buy this canvas weekender from [Bennett Winch](https://rstyle.me/+_yUwsmcbh1ykshJkyaFx7g)\n for myself. The style looks like it would work well with tailoring or workwear, while the separate shoe compartments would let a germaphobe like me rest easy. Will Boehlke, formerly of A Suitable Wardrobe, [carries something similar from Ettinger](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuWlVDknpS8/)\n.\n\nFinally, the promotion includes a ton of loafers and slip-on styled shoes. See these tassel loafers from [Edward Green](https://rstyle.me/+0Yi76f-_H_23LO-xE4O8nA)\n, [black calf](https://rstyle.me/+U2SaRz6tdFeZvXR4CGDQCw)\n and [brown suede penny loafers](https://rstyle.me/+g_O3Wglxp-E8SHi9bP7vtA)\n from George Cleverly, [floppy unlined loafers](https://rstyle.me/+RSviT1C_ncjP3_q2lpWJAw)\n from Edward Green, and white canvas espadrilles from [Castañer](https://rstyle.me/+kuC5Xijp9ZL_z3WYolmBiQ)\n. Edward Green’s Picadilly loafers are my favorite loafers to wear with casual suits and sport coats. They’re terribly expensive (even on sale), but they have a beautiful, sleek shape without being cartoony. [Black is surprisingly nice](https://rstyle.me/+lr96-0g4FRf3HlWr0oB9Xw)\n with navy sport coats and grey trousers, although I don’t wear mine as much as [my dark brown pair](https://rstyle.me/+EQ3UGrB7aM1L-Woju4EQcw)\n. Hooman Majd can be seen wearing a tan pair of Piccadillys at the very top of this post.  \n\nNote, the 20% off promotion ends tonight. Mr. Porter also has an ongoing end-of-season sale, [where you can find select items discounted by as much as 70% off](https://rstyle.me/+JWNjNf6wo6JZYTW_Rp5rVQ)\n. \n\n![](https://66.media.tumblr.com/df052915e25008c852da28b38f6704cd/tumblr_inline_ptgppcNxaH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Mr. Porter’s Summer Flash Sale — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Mr. Porter’s Summer Flash Sale — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"Mr. Porter is having a one-day sale today, where you can get 20% off select items with the checkout code JUNE21.

Since they’re located in Europe, their prices are typically 20% lower than what you’d pay for the same items in the US, thanks to VAT deductions. Which means their end-of-season promotions are even better than what they seem at face value. At the moment, they’re holding their spring/ summer sale, where you can find select items discounted by as much as 60%. Once you account for VAT discounts, however, the sale is actually closer to 68% off. \n\nEND’s online inventory is one of the few that rivals Mr. Porter’s (who, by the way, [just dropped prices for the third time and are having a 70% off sale](https://rstyle.me/+JWNjNf6wo6JZYTW_Rp5rVQ)\n). Which means, your best bet is to [browse through the sale selection](https://bit.ly/2rTUbJZ)\n by filtering for clothing categories and sizes. This way, you can stumble upon things you may not otherwise see. If you’re looking for highlights, here are some things I think are particularly worthwhile. \n\n**Barbour:** If you’re one of the few menswear guys left who doesn’t own a Barbour, [END is one of the best places to score a deal](https://bit.ly/2J81oxl)\n. Again, since their prices are already lower than what you’d typically find stateside, their end-of-season promotions make these especially attractive. These days, I mostly wear the [waxed cotton Bedale in olive](https://bit.ly/2XZqjcx)\n, although the [longer Beaufort is better](https://bit.ly/2XjhUUf)\n for layering over sport coats. [The Liddesdale is also a favorite of many people](https://bit.ly/2FjIa6s)\n. It’s an uber affordable, quilted jacket that looks great with jeans and Shetland sweaters. At END, you can find the Liddesdale at a very low $95, while the waxed cotton models start at $209. For sizing advice, [check out the Barbour buyer’s guide I wrote for Put This On](https://putthison.com/a-buyers-guide-to-barbour-its-been-five-years/)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c4cf6b0996b475e7f88b3a19185e7aa/tumblr_inline_ptdcfxXrj51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/61ad3a0ed35376144d24b8d3e44d7264/tumblr_inline_ptdcgrMXTB1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**Outerwear:** [Last season’s Engineered Garments x Barbour collaboration is available on sale](https://bit.ly/2rKQDaT)\n, including the three models you see above. Each jacket is made from Barbour’s signature waxed cottons, in neutral colors such as olive, black, and navy. The designs are also reworking of some of the company’s archival models. The Cowen, for example, is based off Barbour’s Cowen Commander, a jacket that British soldiers wore in the Falklands War. Others include the Dumbo, which is a fusion between an MA-1 bomber and a varsity jacket. The one-piece raglan sleeves make the jacket easier to fit, while the military-style pockets give it some charm. In the back, you can find a poacher’s pocket, which Barbour has used on their hunting coats. \n\nAdditionally, [Ark Air](https://bit.ly/2L13Vvv)\n is the civilian-wing of an old English company, Arktis, which has been providing standard-issue military wear to special forces around the world since 1985. Over the years, they’ve sold to the French Foreign Legion, US Special Forces, Royal Marines, and elite units in Australia. Their civilian ArkAir line isn’t meant for warfare, but they have the same robust construction and military style. I mostly like them because they’re refreshingly affordable. On sale, these start at $175. \n\nI also like this [Ten C fishtail parka](https://bit.ly/2Rsi6uP)\n (let your inner Mod loose), [Our Legacy Melton wool jacket](https://bit.ly/2Y2rKqG)\n, and [A Kind of Guise chore coat](https://bit.ly/2ZIlCEz)\n. If you’re up for a splurge, [this Margiela MA-1 bomber](https://bit.ly/2RpMDK0)\n looks excellent. It features scrunched up sleeves, which can be found on the military originals, but is woefully missing on many designer versions.\n\n**Sweaters:** [Levi’s Vintage Clothing has a gray cotton sweatshirt](https://bit.ly/2x1HEpi)\n, a wardrobe staple if there ever was one. [Select Jamieson’s Shetland sweaters are also on sale](https://bit.ly/2Xq0xB2)\n. While not as well-known as Brooks Brothers, O’Connell’s, or other trad options, Jamieson’s are the real deal. They’re a family-owned business located in the Shetland Isles, making Shetland sweater and Fair Isle knits from locally sourced Shetland wool yarns. They’re also on the slightly more affordable side of the spectrum at $125 retail (or $79 now on sale). Just be sure to double check END’s site for sizing and measurements. I’ve found some run true-to-size, while others requiring sizing up. You can find measurements on each product page by clicking the sizing tab. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fccaf140dcad74032bcd886b1d1b06cd/tumblr_inline_ptdcbxa33r1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**Shoes:** What’s summer without all-white leather sneakers? These pristine, optical white, premium Italian leather sneakers are an absolute classic and will give you anxiety this summer as you worry about them getting stained from healthy summer activities, such as walking on grass, going to concerts, and eating life-sustaining food. On the upside, they will make you feel slightly cooler than people wearing Chuck Taylors. Plus, they’re on sale, so you’ll only cry for half a day when they inevitably get ruined. I like the ones from [Common Projects](https://bit.ly/2jU9OPz)\n, [Zespa](https://bit.ly/2XldFrf)\n, and [Buttero](https://bit.ly/2FmjXfV)\n. [Zespa also has Stan Smith lookalikes](https://bit.ly/2J81Prt)\n, which will impress your friends if they hang out with you indoors.\n\nAlternatively, [Danner’s hiking boots](https://bit.ly/2x48fCb)\n and [Tricker’s pebble-grained derbies](https://bit.ly/2RnBf17)\n will look better with wear. [Visvim’s Skagways](https://bit.ly/2WZqGYh)\n are also great with anything that can be described as workwear-ish or Americana. If you’re daring, [Buttero has strapped sandals](https://bit.ly/2FnrRFT)\n for a crunchy, hippie look. Mostly, I’m disappointed [these Danner x Nigel Cabourn jungle boots](https://bit.ly/2RurVbS)\n aren’t available in my size. The style isn’t really right for summer clothing, but they’d look great with a parka come fall. See the man himself below. \n\n**Misc:** Finally, [Master Piece makes some of my favorite backpacks](https://bit.ly/2Y2rZSC)\n. They work with contemporary and classic casualwear, are a little sleeker than strictly heritage-styles, and come in upgraded materials (the trims are especially nice). [Barbour’s leather carryall](https://bit.ly/2Fl48Gm)\n would make for a good weekend getaway bag or even an airline carry-on. And if you’re looking to really treat yourself, [Tricker’s shoe valet kit](https://bit.ly/2Fi51iU)\n will carry all your shoe care accessories while looking handsome on your shelf. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d6a44fafb661c19699302d6bdf1c72a5/tumblr_inline_ptdd2qGmcf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/661e8d589f8e685d7f03b8f783af8e64/tumblr_inline_ptdcqs6FHO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nEND, a contemporary menswear shop based in the UK, [always has one of the best end-of-season sales](https://bit.ly/2rTUbJZ)\n.

After all, where else can you find discounted dress shoes sitting alongside rare Japanese labels and American workwear?  Tonight, they started their summer sales event, where you can find select items discounted as much as 50% off. Before you dive in, however, there are some caveats.\n\nFirst, discounts are still being rolled out, and not everything is up yet. You can expect to see the entire sale selection up by tomorrow morning, but it’s worth checking back often since the stock here moves quickly. Second, the best way to tackle their sale is by filtering for sizes – pants in size 32 or shoes in size 9. That way, you raise your chance of coming across a serendipitous find. Third, if you’re on the fence about something, I suggest buying it. You can always return things for free if they don’t work out. \n\n[You can browse the sale on Mr. Porter’s dedicated sales page](https://rstyle.me/n/c4z5wunjge)\n, at least for what’s currently already up, but here are some things I think are notable:\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/33954796806a88159f71ab13ebcbcae0/tumblr_inline_ps7bd06zlF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**Outerwear:** One of my favorite jackets, [Marigela’s five-zip](https://rstyle.me/+YmSeKePt9XA9FutxhVZgzg)\n, is available right now in sand suede. The color goes well with blue jeans, black denim, and even grey trousers. [Our Legacy’s tan suede trucker](https://rstyle.me/+Owlh7G2xWqsopP1uIiyCvg)\n and [AMI’s shearling](https://rstyle.me/+k4FP2-rf8f5AZrwvvQGhZw)\n can be worn in much the same way. Additionally, [Valstar’s suede bombers and shearling truckers](https://rstyle.me/+X7_V-8zNCKbLX4oYKhlo_g)\n look good on almost anyone. [Monitaly](https://rstyle.me/+rguW4bFZ_1mjdpqSmqt3AQ)\n and [Ten C](https://rstyle.me/+eZH6cmdDTSxNZiTR_Jz7yg)\n make some excellent military parkas, [Private White VC](https://rstyle.me/+vHjqiFchbIAlJq-w18NV1Q)\n has smart-casual bombers, and [Mackintosh](https://rstyle.me/+1rR5gn2qCL7xeuiMcPXw1Q)\n does bonded raincoats really well. There’s also this [Rubinacci grey herringbone double-breasted overcoat](https://rstyle.me/+1zbyUFqb-QX9xfSMGeOQpw)\n if you want something dressier.

After all, where else can you find discounted dress shoes sitting alongside rare Japanese labels and American workwear?  Tonight, they started their summer sales event, where you can find select items discounted as much as 50% off. Before you dive in, however, there are some caveats.\n\nFirst, discounts are still being rolled out, and not everything is up yet. You can expect to see the entire sale selection up by tomorrow morning, but it’s worth checking back often since the stock here moves quickly. Second, the best way to tackle their sale is by filtering for sizes – pants in size 32 or shoes in size 9. That way, you raise your chance of coming across a serendipitous find. Third, if you’re on the fence about something, I suggest buying it. You can always return things for free if they don’t work out. \n\n[You can browse the sale on Mr. Porter’s dedicated sales page](https://rstyle.me/n/c4z5wunjge)\n, at least for what’s currently already up, but here are some things I think are notable:\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/33954796806a88159f71ab13ebcbcae0/tumblr_inline_ps7bd06zlF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**Outerwear:** One of my favorite jackets, [Marigela’s five-zip](https://rstyle.me/+YmSeKePt9XA9FutxhVZgzg)\n, is available right now in sand suede.

They were responding to a letter published in _The Bicycle_ magazine the previous October. Penned by W.H. Paul — a thin, bespectacled man better known to his friends as Bill — the letter asked if the cyclists of the day were only interested in replicating the road-racing feats of Tour de France competitors. Paul, an enthusiast of the great outdoors, wondered if anyone else liked using bikes to explore less trodden paths.\n\n“I have always been a searcher of the remote, wild, and more desolate country, which is to be seen ‘off the beaten track,’” he wrote. “I wonder if the modern lightweight, with its ‘Continental this’ and ‘super that,’ prompts the rider to keep on the billard-table surfaces of modern tarmacs. Nevertheless, I believe there is still a small select circle who love the rough and high ways amongst the mountains of Wales, the Lakes, and Scotland. \\[…\\] Who then, would care to become a member of The Rough-Stuff Fellowship?”\n\nThe response was immediate and positive. A year after the inaugural meeting, the club grew from 40 hardened riders to 160 scattered across the country — [and today is 800 members strong](https://www.rsf.org.uk/)\n, making it the oldest off-road bicycling club in the world. Riders meet on a weekly, if not daily basis to explore every corner of the British countryside and beyond. They shoulder their bikes as they climb up mountains and wade through streams, then hop on them again to ride across rocky dirty paths and through grass-covered fields. “They prefer a far less beaten track – one where no ascent is too steep, no mud too thick, no destination too distant,” [Niall Flynn wrote of the group](https://www.huckmag.com/outdoor/bikes/rough-stuff-fellowship-archive-photography-off-road-cycling/)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0563d27baf0d054c673b2b5e81d4c4cc/tumblr_inline_ps00cfP9kK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5587a27dba8f4ada25759d6901622140/tumblr_inline_ps008d4vvQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe history of mountain biking often starts during the 1970s, when riders in California and Colorado tinkered with their bikes to adapt them to the rigors of off-roading. But few people know about the British men and women who covered similar terrain with the same bicycles they used to get to work. They rode simple bikes with three or four speeds, Sturmey-Archer gears, and no _derailleurs_ — the last being the L-shaped mechanism you see hanging off modern frames, which moves the chain between the cogs on a rear wheel’s cassette. “This was for the best, really,” says Mark Hudson, the club’s recently appointed archivist. “If you had _derailleur_ at the back, it would have been prone to smashing up against the rocks. Whereas, if you have a hub gear, everything is kept inboard and contained in a shell.”\n\nThe Rough-Stuff Fellowship’s early members, however, would have probably appreciated having wider tires. Theirs were thin and designed for smoother paved roads, which meant they felt every bump and crevice when they went off-roading. Not uncommonly, they had to repair their tires when they got bent out of shape mid-adventure. And yet, for this strange band of people, this was somehow all part of the fun. “There is a sense of humor to it, isn’t there?” says Hudson. “I think that’s what people today have latched onto — that contrast between the toughness and the humor. It’s very British.”\n\nIn Scotland, there’s a 28-mile hill-pass known as Lairig Ghru, which climbs to a dizzying 3,000 feet and crosses through the central Cairngorms, one of the wildest areas in the country. It’s described as going from Speyside to Deeside (as a sedentary music lover, I’ve only ever ventured to the B-side). Hudson says that it’s a classic Rough-Stuff route. “There’s a drovers’ road, just wide enough for a sheep and cart to go down, but it’s otherwise a boulder field. I think someone calculated that it’s only about 20% ridable, which means you’re spending a lot of your time climbing rocks and shouldering a bike on your back. A lot of walkers don’t even cross it.”\n\nOver the years, members of The Rough-Stuff Fellowship have pitted their bikes against the natural world in the most unlikely of places. They were the first to cross Iceland’s vast interior on a bicycle, completely unassisted, in 1958 (Horace Dall did it first in 1933, but took a boat across the tundra). “It was the first time I had even been out of England. So, everything was new and different to me,” says Dick Phillips, one of the cyclists on that team. Members have also ridden across the French Alps and Swiss mountains. During a world tour, one of the chapters threw in a visit to Mount Everest’s base camp just for the fun of it. “They were the first to reach it by bike,” says Hudson. “The essence is that you can take your bike _wherever_ you want to take it. Rough-Stuff is about a pioneering spirit – just wanting to see what’s over the hills.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fb54e368c21ba96b574863ff2341b360/tumblr_inline_ps008uz6jM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nA few years ago, after being appointed archivist, Hudson started scouring for photos, documents, and letters. He struck gold when he came across an unusually large collection: 10,000 slide photos, which were previously owned by founding member Bob Harrison until he passed away. A cabinet maker by trade, Harrison lovingly made thirty-four, felt-lined, oak boxes to house his 35mm slide collection — each box indexed and every photo labeled with the date and location of a ride he took with The Rough-Stuff Fellowship. “That’s the collection that really kicked things off,” says Hudson. \n\nIn the end, Hudson gathered a total of 20,000 photos, a small selection of which are being shared on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rsfarchive/)\n and will be part of a forthcoming book titled _[The Rough-Stuff Fellowship Archive.](https://roughstuffarchive.com/)\n_ “I live in a one bedroom flat, and I’m absolutely sinking,” Hudson laughs. “Of the 20,000 slides, about 200 made it into the book. Max Leonard from Isola Press and I went through and projected each of the slides on a big screen to figure out which should be included. It was a fun but hard process.”\n\nScanning the photos, I’m struck by how early members of The Rough-Stuff Fellowship dressed. Instead of cycling specific clothing, they wore the same things they used for work and leisure. They rode in Shetland sweaters and collared shirts, waxed parkas and hooded ponchos, corduroy shorts and long wool socks. Some are also spotted wearing traditional leather shoes. Which makes sense, really, since this was before the boom in cycling technology, where consumers could get highly specialized bike parts and body-hugging Lycra uniforms. Many of the outfits here look like they could have come straight out of a [Nigel Cabourn](https://bit.ly/2t1S31o)\n or [Barbour](https://rstyle.me/+ECl9jHDOSmSLzWu4d1S7eg)\n lookbook. In the photo above, the man carrying his bike over rocks is wearing what could pass for an [LL Bean Norwegian sweater](https://rstyle.me/+XuzwxzdBIZkmD6m3F3I0Dg)\n and a [pair of corded Engineered Garments shorts](https://rstyle.me/+Geg4Gx26ON7toeIXTyHPpA)\n.\n\n“Very few things back then were designed specifically for cycling,” Hudson explains. “There was a company called Bertram Dudley and Son that made the Greenspot jacket, which was popular with touring cyclists. That had two slanted zipped chest pockets, two lower hand pockets, and two more pockets at the back, as you’d see on contemporary cycling jerseys. That was the only cycling specific garment, but you didn’t need much else because you weren’t going terribly fast. Wool keeps you warm, and it breathes. Today, people know all these terms for things, but back then, people didn’t have all these options and probably couldn’t even name every part of their bike. They wore what they wore and used what they used.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ae1eebf2562cd103ac70febcd9a6510/tumblr_inline_ps00bviFo81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nIn his book _[Bowling Alone](https://rstyle.me/+UGdVxkxRkX3ViaiT4TeoGg)\n_, Harvard professor Robert Putnam details the collapse of American community life. In one of his chapters, he goes through statistics for how civic participation has changed throughout the 20th century – everything from active organizational involvement to club meeting attendance. By any measure, things are the lowest they’ve been in decades. The average membership rate for thirty-two associations in 1997 was about half that of the 1960s, putting the ‘90s rates on par with those during the Great Depression. To the degree that people still participate in civic life, they tend to be through big organizations – ones where they have to do little more than read monthly newsletters and donate money. Putnam writes:\n\n> Few ever attend any meetings of such organizations – many never have meetings at all – and most members are unlikely to ever knowingly encounter any other member. The bond between any two members of the National Wildlife Federation or the National Rifle Association is less like the bond between two members of a gardening club or prayer group and more like the bond between two Yankees fans on opposite coasts (or perhaps two devoted L.L. Bean catalog users): they share the same interests, but they are unaware of each other’s existence. Their ties are to common symbols, common leaders, and perhaps common ideals, but not to each other.\n\nThe Rough-Stuff Fellowship is one of those rare clubs that bands people together around physical activity. In the archival photos, you can see how all-terrain, sometimes foolhardy rides help build real-life camaraderie and friendships (in his book, Putnam makes a strong case for how military conscription can break down racial and class prejudices, as recruits have to entrust their lives in other people’s hands). \n\n“The club brings together people from all walks of life,” says Hudson. “In the photos, there are some images of Jerry and Elsie, who rode tandem together. They were friends with Bob and Mary, who also rode tandem. Together, they went on multi-week tours. They met through the club and spent thirty years together until Jerry passed away in the 1980s. Their friendship lasted about half their lives.”\n\nI ask Hudson how much someone should expect to spend if they want to take a bike out into the wild like this. “You can spend as little as $150 for a basic road bike or spend the world for the latest gear,” he says. “Fundamentally, you don’t need much. You need two wheels and a sense of adventure, and the second thing is free.” Well, those things along with a [Shetland sweater](https://bit.ly/2s2Ot9A)\n, [Nigel Cabourn jacket](https://bit.ly/2t1S31o)\n, and [pair of Alden boots](https://bit.ly/2wsPmst)\n. At least if you want to look as stylish as the riders pictured here. \n\n_(Special thanks to Iain for tipping me to this story.

a Sunday afternoon in May of 1955, a ragtag group of forty people crammed themselves into The Black Swan, a cozy pub in the market town of Leominster, England. They were responding to a letter published in _The Bicycle_ magazine the previous October. Penned by W.H. Paul — a thin, bespectacled man better known to his friends as Bill — the letter asked if the cyclists of the day were only interested in replicating the road-racing feats of Tour de France competitors. Paul, an enthusiast of the great outdoors, wondered if anyone else liked using bikes to explore less trodden paths.\n\n“I have always been a searcher of the remote, wild, and more desolate country, which is to be seen ‘off the beaten track,’” he wrote. “I wonder if the modern lightweight, with its ‘Continental this’ and ‘super that,’ prompts the rider to keep on the billard-table surfaces of modern tarmacs. Nevertheless, I believe there is still a small select circle who love the rough and high ways amongst the mountains of Wales, the Lakes, and Scotland. \\[…\\] Who then, would care to become a member of The Rough-Stuff Fellowship?”\n\nThe response was immediate and positive. A year after the inaugural meeting, the club grew from 40 hardened riders to 160 scattered across the country — [and today is 800 members strong](https://www.rsf.org.uk/)\n, making it the oldest off-road bicycling club in the world. Riders meet on a weekly, if not daily basis to explore every corner of the British countryside and beyond. They shoulder their bikes as they climb up mountains and wade through streams, then hop on them again to ride across rocky dirty paths and through grass-covered fields. “They prefer a far less beaten track – one where no ascent is too steep, no mud too thick, no destination too distant,” [Niall Flynn wrote of the group](https://www.huckmag.com/outdoor/bikes/rough-stuff-fellowship-archive-photography-off-road-cycling/)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0563d27baf0d054c673b2b5e81d4c4cc/tumblr_inline_ps00cfP9kK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5587a27dba8f4ada25759d6901622140/tumblr_inline_ps008d4vvQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThe history of mountain biking often starts during the 1970s, when riders in California and Colorado tinkered with their bikes to adapt them to the rigors of off-roading. But few people know about the British men and women who covered similar terrain with the same bicycles they used to get to work. They rode simple bikes with three or four speeds, Sturmey-Archer gears, and no _derailleurs_ — the last being the L-shaped mechanism you see hanging off modern frames, which moves the chain between the cogs on a rear wheel’s cassette. “This was for the best, really,” says Mark Hudson, the club’s recently appointed archivist. “If you had _derailleur_ at the back, it would have been prone to smashing up against the rocks. Whereas, if you have a hub gear, everything is kept inboard and contained in a shell.”\n\nThe Rough-Stuff Fellowship’s early members, however, would have probably appreciated having wider tires. Theirs were thin and designed for smoother paved roads, which meant they felt every bump and crevice when they went off-roading. Not uncommonly, they had to repair their tires when they got bent out of shape mid-adventure. And yet, for this strange band of people, this was somehow all part of the fun. “There is a sense of humor to it, isn’t there?” says Hudson. “I think that’s what people today have latched onto — that contrast between the toughness and the humor. It’s very British.”\n\nIn Scotland, there’s a 28-mile hill-pass known as Lairig Ghru, which climbs to a dizzying 3,000 feet and crosses through the central Cairngorms, one of the wildest areas in the country. It’s described as going from Speyside to Deeside (as a sedentary music lover, I’ve only ever ventured to the B-side). Hudson says that it’s a classic Rough-Stuff route. “There’s a drovers’ road, just wide enough for a sheep and cart to go down, but it’s otherwise a boulder field. I think someone calculated that it’s only about 20% ridable, which means you’re spending a lot of your time climbing rocks and shouldering a bike on your back. A lot of walkers don’t even cross it.”\n\nOver the years, members of The Rough-Stuff Fellowship have pitted their bikes against the natural world in the most unlikely of places. They were the first to cross Iceland’s vast interior on a bicycle, completely unassisted, in 1958 (Horace Dall did it first in 1933, but took a boat across the tundra). “It was the first time I had even been out of England. So, everything was new and different to me,” says Dick Phillips, one of the cyclists on that team. Members have also ridden across the French Alps and Swiss mountains. During a world tour, one of the chapters threw in a visit to Mount Everest’s base camp just for the fun of it. “They were the first to reach it by bike,” says Hudson. “The essence is that you can take your bike _wherever_ you want to take it. Rough-Stuff is about a pioneering spirit – just wanting to see what’s over the hills.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fb54e368c21ba96b574863ff2341b360/tumblr_inline_ps008uz6jM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nA few years ago, after being appointed archivist, Hudson started scouring for photos, documents, and letters. He struck gold when he came across an unusually large collection: 10,000 slide photos, which were previously owned by founding member Bob Harrison until he passed away. A cabinet maker by trade, Harrison lovingly made thirty-four, felt-lined, oak boxes to house his 35mm slide collection — each box indexed and every photo labeled with the date and location of a ride he took with The Rough-Stuff Fellowship. “That’s the collection that really kicked things off,” says Hudson. \n\nIn the end, Hudson gathered a total of 20,000 photos, a small selection of which are being shared on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rsfarchive/)\n and will be part of a forthcoming book titled _[The Rough-Stuff Fellowship Archive.](https://roughstuffarchive.com/)\n_ “I live in a one bedroom flat, and I’m absolutely sinking,” Hudson laughs. “Of the 20,000 slides, about 200 made it into the book. Max Leonard from Isola Press and I went through and projected each of the slides on a big screen to figure out which should be included. It was a fun but hard process.”\n\nScanning the photos, I’m struck by how early members of The Rough-Stuff Fellowship dressed. Instead of cycling specific clothing, they wore the same things they used for work and leisure. They rode in Shetland sweaters and collared shirts, waxed parkas and hooded ponchos, corduroy shorts and long wool socks. Some are also spotted wearing traditional leather shoes. Which makes sense, really, since this was before the boom in cycling technology, where consumers could get highly specialized bike parts and body-hugging Lycra uniforms. Many of the outfits here look like they could have come straight out of a [Nigel Cabourn](https://bit.ly/2t1S31o)\n or [Barbour](https://rstyle.me/+ECl9jHDOSmSLzWu4d1S7eg)\n lookbook. In the photo above, the man carrying his bike over rocks is wearing what could pass for an [LL Bean Norwegian sweater](https://rstyle.me/+XuzwxzdBIZkmD6m3F3I0Dg)\n and a [pair of corded Engineered Garments shorts](https://rstyle.me/+Geg4Gx26ON7toeIXTyHPpA)\n.\n\n“Very few things back then were designed specifically for cycling,” Hudson explains. “There was a company called Bertram Dudley and Son that made the Greenspot jacket, which was popular with touring cyclists. That had two slanted zipped chest pockets, two lower hand pockets, and two more pockets at the back, as you’d see on contemporary cycling jerseys. That was the only cycling specific garment, but you didn’t need much else because you weren’t going terribly fast. Wool keeps you warm, and it breathes. Today, people know all these terms for things, but back then, people didn’t have all these options and probably couldn’t even name every part of their bike. They wore what they wore and used what they used.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ae1eebf2562cd103ac70febcd9a6510/tumblr_inline_ps00bviFo81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nIn his book _[Bowling Alone](https://rstyle.me/+UGdVxkxRkX3ViaiT4TeoGg)\n_, Harvard professor Robert Putnam details the collapse of American community life. In one of his chapters, he goes through statistics for how civic participation has changed throughout the 20th century – everything from active organizational involvement to club meeting attendance. By any measure, things are the lowest they’ve been in decades. The average membership rate for thirty-two associations in 1997 was about half that of the 1960s, putting the ‘90s rates on par with those during the Great Depression. To the degree that people still participate in civic life, they tend to be through big organizations – ones where they have to do little more than read monthly newsletters and donate money. Putnam writes:\n\n> Few ever attend any meetings of such organizations – many never have meetings at all – and most members are unlikely to ever knowingly encounter any other member. The bond between any two members of the National Wildlife Federation or the National Rifle Association is less like the bond between two members of a gardening club or prayer group and more like the bond between two Yankees fans on opposite coasts (or perhaps two devoted L.L. Bean catalog users): they share the same interests, but they are unaware of each other’s existence. Their ties are to common symbols, common leaders, and perhaps common ideals, but not to each other.\n\nThe Rough-Stuff Fellowship is one of those rare clubs that bands people together around physical activity. In the archival photos, you can see how all-terrain, sometimes foolhardy rides help build real-life camaraderie and friendships (in his book, Putnam makes a strong case for how military conscription can break down racial and class prejudices, as recruits have to entrust their lives in other people’s hands). \n\n“The club brings together people from all walks of life,” says Hudson. “In the photos, there are some images of Jerry and Elsie, who rode tandem together. They were friends with Bob and Mary, who also rode tandem. Together, they went on multi-week tours. They met through the club and spent thirty years together until Jerry passed away in the 1980s. Their friendship lasted about half their lives.”\n\nI ask Hudson how much someone should expect to spend if they want to take a bike out into the wild like this. “You can spend as little as $150 for a basic road bike or spend the world for the latest gear,” he says. “Fundamentally, you don’t need much. You need two wheels and a sense of adventure, and the second thing is free.” Well, those things along with a [Shetland sweater](https://bit.ly/2s2Ot9A)\n, [Nigel Cabourn jacket](https://bit.ly/2t1S31o)\n, and [pair of Alden boots](https://bit.ly/2wsPmst)\n. At least if you want to look as stylish as the riders pictured here. \n\n_(Special thanks to Iain for tipping me to this story.

Those gift cards are as good as cash, which means you can use them on already-discounted items. The best thing about this promotion? It’s running concurrently with two special sales.\n\nThe first is a shirt sale, where you can get a 25% discount when you purchase three or more shirts. The promotion applies to Brooks Brother’s famous oxford-cloth button-downs, which come in [solid colors](https://rstyle.me/+oOC9Hc4k_es0Rm0RiJaxdw)\n and [various](https://rstyle.me/+dFIxmECr-eA86np4byw3Zw)\n [types of](https://rstyle.me/+P_5fYTfp4nIKuExgoAjQvQ)\n [stripes](https://rstyle.me/+rQXDoTKwmyZnqT3RAFJZMQ)\n. Since the company upgraded to its unlined collar a few years ago, the price jumped from about $90 to $140. With the two current promotions, however, the price comes down to $88 — lower than the previous years’ retail. I find light-blue oxford button-downs can be worn with anything described as Ivy, Americana, or even workwear (e.g., suits and sport coats, field jackets, or brands like [Engineered Garments](https://rstyle.me/+6ZBJnp48DOTZ75gZC9UkgQ)\n). I hesitate to call anything a wardrobe essential, but for me, an OCBD is as close to essential as anything comes.\n\nBrooks Brothers also put their two most iconic loafers on sale: their tassel loafer — which comes in [calfskin](https://rstyle.me/+HlQoYKyuY3VTfq03L9W6qQ)\n, [shell cordovan](https://rstyle.me/+NBMIVkptczIv9X69qw2Y6Q)\n, and [two shades of](https://rstyle.me/+nfkm9VWMYiq9FVxh_DJ6Eg)\n [brown suede](https://rstyle.me/+qnKUDM37zaEmXEYfJ6DD6w)\n – and their [unlined shell cordovan penny loafers](https://rstyle.me/+H1dOT6hn4qcvbGlYuBP6ig)\n (both styles made in the USA by Alden). Those shell cordo pennies are among my favorite shoes. Not only can they be worn with your usual sport coats and flannels, but they can also work in surprisingly contemporary contexts.

If you stack these sales with the current gift card promotion, the tassel loafers start at $368 (down from $558), and the shell cordovan penny loafers are $486 (down from $748). \n\nSome notes about the gift card promotion:\n\n*   You get a free $25 eGift card when you buy a $150+ eGift card online. That means, if you plan on purchasing a $300 gift card, I recommend checking out twice with a $150 gift card so that you can get two free $25 gift cards, rather than just one.\n*   You will receive the eGift cards by email immediately upon paying. Note that the free gift cards expire in six months upon issuance, but the ones you purchase have no expiration date (this shouldn’t be a problem if you use them immediately for this sale, however).\n*   I’m told each customer is limited to five gift cards, which means you can check out five times with $150 eGift cards for a maximum of five free $25 eGift cards.\n\nFor more great deals, browse through [Brooks Brother’s sale section.](https://rstyle.me/+cy6ZrPHW4bWu9Rn2NL2i8A)\n The gift card promotion can be stacked on other already-discounted items, such as these [perf-toe oxfords](https://rstyle.me/+Rap5lO2uSKtI60c7MdCjww)\n and [suede cap-toe derbies](https://rstyle.me/+WGJHeDaF1OV89yK8a_MowQ)\n.

Like many men of his generation, Akamine went into the clothing trade in the 1960s, right around the time Japanese youths were picking up button-down collars and Levi’s 501s. Akamine was one of the young men enamored with classic style, so he decided to make a career out of it. Over the years, he’s helped translate British, American, and Italian style for a Japanese audience. In the 1970s, he had a clothing brand called Way Out, which was managed under his umbrella company Trad. He’s consulted for United Arrows and provided personal styling services for executives. He even played a pioneering role in Japan’s Italian restaurant boom in the early ‘90s, when he oversaw Tokyo’s Il Boccalone and La bis Boccia, two restaurants for Tuscan cuisine. \n\nIf Akamine’s style feels cinematic, it’s because he developed his eye by watching old films. In interviews, he’s talked about his love for movies starring American actors such as Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart, or ones directed by Italian filmmakers such as Federico Fellini, Roberto Rossellini, and Luchino Visconti. Consequently, his style is a multicultural soup of English, Italian, and French influences. He wears suits and sport coats from Liverano, ties from Drake’s, shirts from Charvet, and shoes from John Lobb. His jackets have a shoulder line that’s soft and sloping, but also slightly extended to give his frame a flattering V-shaped figure. The trousers are trim; the overcoats generously sized. The shirt collars are long enough such that the points neatly tuck behind his jacket’s lapels.\n\nAs conservative as his style may seem, Akamine’s outfits are full of personality. Knits are layered on top of each other and socks are worn to match dress shirts. Some of his single-breasted jackets even have both patch pockets and peak lapels (a daring combination). Plus, there are those deep, deep two-inch cuffs. On most men, these things would seem affected, but on Akamine, they look so good and natural. Whether it’s because of his handsome face or age, I don’t know. I’ll give them a try when I’m in my 70s so I can at least tell if you if it’s the latter.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd7d03ee5d5402ee616a8762a9f77fc5/tumblr_inline_pq77b1E6iN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/81fb84e937f08daac4320cf51ca4e644/tumblr_inline_pq77b7Ft6z1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Akamine also runs one of my favorite Instagram accounts](https://www.instagram.com/akamineyukio)\n. I love the photos for how they feel so pure — just a man who enjoys clothes, posing in different daily outfits (never a single one repeated), and shot plainly in what looks to be a residential courtyard. Sometimes he posts the same photo two or three times in a row. I’d like to think it’s because he wants his friends to get recognition (in the images above, you can see him with Douglas Cordeaux, Antonio Liverano, and the co-owners of Il Vecchio Drappiere). The real reason is likely simpler – he probably doesn’t know how to use his iPhone, which somehow manages to be even more charming. [Here he is accidentally shooting an off-centered photo of his outfit](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlFtqQhl8an/)\n. The man is an absolute treasure. \n\nThe idea of timelessness is often overwrought, overused, and even overvalued, but there’s something to be said about how Akamine’s style has aged so well over the years. Even the cut of his suits seemingly hasn’t changed much since he was photographed alongside his friends [Luciano Barbera and Toshio Shirai in 1993](https://www.instagram.com/p/BGlQf6tskHa/)\n. In an old interview for the now-defunct site For the Discerning Few, Akamine said: \n\n> I believe that the components of style emanate from within: intelligence, character, personality. Clothes matter, but they cannot give you style. More important than how many centimeters of shirt cuff you are showing is that you be in sync with the way you dress. We are almost like characters in a film, we are moving, living characters, we are playing ourselves. That cinematic approach to style is what’s most interesting about men’s dress.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> Some people have more financial resources than they have taste, so whatever they do, they tend to do it in a pretty bad style. Internet at some level tends to be the cause of that. People are all about the moment, they want things to happen right away without taking the time to learn and to appreciate anything. I believe that you see a continuity of taste in a person’s life from the way they speak, the way they conduct themselves, and from the way their house is set up and furnished.\n> \n> The shoes I wear today are from John Lobb, they are 25 years old. When I first got them, they weren’t really comfortable, but after 25 years, they really feel comfortable. With beautiful things, it is all about learning to wait, being patient. People today, they don’t want to give it time. But it is like love, it is like a relationship, it is like learning, like all the things we admire, it takes time. Anything that happens in the snap of a finger isn’t good.\n\nThis site is mostly full of random posts until I can gather enough photos to do a post on Akamine. That’s been made easier in recent years since he joined Instagram. He’s also become something of an online style celebrity, often making appearances on street style accounts such as [Jamie Ferguson](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuTQ80eBKYJ/)\n, [Sartorial Notes](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu8I4LVn7T8/)\n, [Flannels & Tweed](https://www.instagram.com/p/BV6syt0AfSm/)\n, and [Thousand Yard Style](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhHYGfPl-Ac/)\n. The Rake Japan’s fashion editor, [Yuko Fujita](https://www.instagram.com/yuko_fujita_1224/?hl=en)\n, documented Akamine’s personal wardrobe. [I’ve also written two](https://dieworkwear.com/post/98812298433/that-japanese-italian-style)\n [other posts about him](https://dieworkwear.com/post/168021945874/living-style-legend-yukio-akamine)\n. Lastly, the Japanese YouTube channel Forza Style regularly features Akamine. [He talks about general men’s style topics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8nvdGea4M)\n and covers basics such as [how to press trousers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fI4ALsg1t4)\n, [tie a tie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWW0ssV7oVo&t=7s)\n, [wear a gray suit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjmZe8ugSkY)\n, and [accessorize an outfit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXXX6RObivI)\n. They also tour [Akamine’s little vintage shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkuejE8h-M4)\n. Hopefully, those videos will hold you over until I can find another fifty photos for a post on the most stylish man alive. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b6954139ed15db84da36f7a3e08bb8f/tumblr_inline_pq8jki6LaX1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ce892b489ec8ecc13d5c7129136f8aa/tumblr_inline_pq76f9ZBvF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7504875040555debf20f15d825c88fd0/tumblr_inline_pq76dwtZX11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/58adb6e45396c4518aae192dfd285f63/tumblr_inline_pq8jjoaMYO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/106838cad93abbfa351d30d0a0c5e011/tumblr_inline_pq76gzZTj51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/766dce06bd28f7cadf02b47b7dffd886/tumblr_inline_pq8ji9wO6i1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/594155459d98471b7d36257b7bd6bb99/tumblr_inline_pq76gybItw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0701877974392fa6864bc8c8bb244054/tumblr_inline_pq76dqY8Wd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0b7e502427d2f9f3d65451eb11a4f2e/tumblr_inline_pq76g0953X1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a710868f4af558320de170b37e149f95/tumblr_inline_pq76ndJZwY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5fe69b4c006ae9752b31f962251353ea/tumblr_inline_pq76hiqBKP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71a35b15b9eaa06d2f4d8d5e880e288e/tumblr_inline_pq76faFlsn1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e69353bef741e1717f6c67f033363aa8/tumblr_inline_pq76lauzhg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e7dd28663a132a1a1c8db25dfe19715d/tumblr_inline_pq76kz4KBk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/48ce067e6f0d768363887b86384b759c/tumblr_inline_pq76lmaXQQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f7ef2c119da1bc3e1b7877e79cf5853/tumblr_inline_pq76kkkh0Q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8de23c04773b4e5f7ef5645beaf14eab/tumblr_inline_pq76kpwlGW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fed5970ca508dbe7e4e61b1223b1381a/tumblr_inline_pq76lsT3041qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/72a0e62b07c55e2de574589ce86398b5/tumblr_inline_pq76khjMrp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/65f8566edce53459fd7b9a4bdfec2330/tumblr_inline_pq76l4c4w31qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4371b87a238813824666d4dffc1f0353/tumblr_inline_pq76lgsT7j1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8b985459456d093bb842dca1b5e739a/tumblr_inline_pq76fx456P1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2d34b12a73b11dce63f1cecf9e45d1c/tumblr_inline_pq76f83wf11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40a8214a787045503b7c4a5d891dd301/tumblr_inline_pq76j1OajP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a5d0be39c544dd2207948f4b85c62c53/tumblr_inline_pq76hjP43B1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/17552e062056d9a425021387cc0fb808/tumblr_inline_pq76hme1sO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/54154d9a8595a94aaa42f2ec12d02cc7/tumblr_inline_pq76hpXjMk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ac821e781617906e89b1ec695cb0e9b9/tumblr_inline_pq76hr3PRR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/49af05a3a86d52c6cf6f64b813d40c27/tumblr_inline_pq76htwID81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/38588e83bddaf19a8d0843a6eaa41bd7/tumblr_inline_pq76gvNJB91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/839491ae4adbdb63e6dd5772e49e551a/tumblr_inline_pq76e2Iib61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/23b2af3447bd6658226c453e9528c51f/tumblr_inline_pq76gnmHIQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd76a88d2a817038512603c1787d64e3/tumblr_inline_pq76gnqN841qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c528b69e8c2afd1bfca698198b58677/tumblr_inline_pq76gqiIQG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c3fa40561cc6a043601d509e758c6df/tumblr_inline_pq76gslWuk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2349e53a3cbf6d975ca3cea6717ae35/tumblr_inline_pq76gtWFsM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2bb3df07f0e4c37521e8786c064fb011/tumblr_inline_pq76gwwDdi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef996d4ba75874b2c8293b7138000d49/tumblr_inline_pq76gxdJdd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cfbb03518c2b9a10e50b9b158dcf96ef/tumblr_inline_pq76f7VAVR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0b154e88a5ab366be0ac1f2485f9705/tumblr_inline_pq76fumUg61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/99033920dd13e532aa030b10d9f2a254/tumblr_inline_pq76fu4Cnp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/851bb4b0afb68ad8bdabe3feca38b5fd/tumblr_inline_pq76fzRhTu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/41322da3b79327d33b9ef91092b6a427/tumblr_inline_pq76g11l6S1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a12a474960a19de993ad90ad08d6533/tumblr_inline_pq7

The man is an absolute treasure. \n\nThe idea of timelessness is often overwrought, overused, and even overvalued, but there’s something to be said about how Akamine’s style has aged so well over the years. Even the cut of his suits seemingly hasn’t changed much since he was photographed alongside his friends [Luciano Barbera and Toshio Shirai in 1993](https://www.instagram.com/p/BGlQf6tskHa/)\n. In an old interview for the now-defunct site For the Discerning Few, Akamine said: \n\n> I believe that the components of style emanate from within: intelligence, character, personality. Clothes matter, but they cannot give you style. More important than how many centimeters of shirt cuff you are showing is that you be in sync with the way you dress. We are almost like characters in a film, we are moving, living characters, we are playing ourselves. That cinematic approach to style is what’s most interesting about men’s dress.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> Some people have more financial resources than they have taste, so whatever they do, they tend to do it in a pretty bad style. Internet at some level tends to be the cause of that. People are all about the moment, they want things to happen right away without taking the time to learn and to appreciate anything. I believe that you see a continuity of taste in a person’s life from the way they speak, the way they conduct themselves, and from the way their house is set up and furnished.\n> \n> The shoes I wear today are from John Lobb, they are 25 years old. When I first got them, they weren’t really comfortable, but after 25 years, they really feel comfortable. With beautiful things, it is all about learning to wait, being patient. People today, they don’t want to give it time. But it is like love, it is like a relationship, it is like learning, like all the things we admire, it takes time. Anything that happens in the snap of a finger isn’t good.\n\nThis site is mostly full of random posts until I can gather enough photos to do a post on Akamine. That’s been made easier in recent years since he joined Instagram. He’s also become something of an online style celebrity, often making appearances on street style accounts such as [Jamie Ferguson](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuTQ80eBKYJ/)\n, [Sartorial Notes](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu8I4LVn7T8/)\n, [Flannels & Tweed](https://www.instagram.com/p/BV6syt0AfSm/)\n, and [Thousand Yard Style](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhHYGfPl-Ac/)\n. The Rake Japan’s fashion editor, [Yuko Fujita](https://www.instagram.com/yuko_fujita_1224/?hl=en)\n, documented Akamine’s personal wardrobe. [I’ve also written two](https://dieworkwear.com/post/98812298433/that-japanese-italian-style)\n [other posts about him](https://dieworkwear.com/post/168021945874/living-style-legend-yukio-akamine)\n. Lastly, the Japanese YouTube channel Forza Style regularly features Akamine. [He talks about general men’s style topics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8nvdGea4M)\n and covers basics such as [how to press trousers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fI4ALsg1t4)\n, [tie a tie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWW0ssV7oVo&t=7s)\n, [wear a gray suit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjmZe8ugSkY)\n, and [accessorize an outfit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXXX6RObivI)\n. They also tour [Akamine’s little vintage shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkuejE8h-M4)\n. Hopefully, those videos will hold you over until I can find another fifty photos for a post on the most stylish man alive. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b6954139ed15db84da36f7a3e08bb8f/tumblr_inline_pq8jki6LaX1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ce892b489ec8ecc13d5c7129136f8aa/tumblr_inline_pq76f9ZBvF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7504875040555debf20f15d825c88fd0/tumblr_inline_pq76dwtZX11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/58adb6e45396c4518aae192dfd285f63/tumblr_inline_pq8jjoaMYO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/106838cad93abbfa351d30d0a0c5e011/tumblr_inline_pq76gzZTj51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/766dce06bd28f7cadf02b47b7dffd886/tumblr_inline_pq8ji9wO6i1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/594155459d98471b7d36257b7bd6bb99/tumblr_inline_pq76gybItw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0701877974392fa6864bc8c8bb244054/tumblr_inline_pq76dqY8Wd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0b7e502427d2f9f3d65451eb11a4f2e/tumblr_inline_pq76g0953X1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a710868f4af558320de170b37e149f95/tumblr_inline_pq76ndJZwY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5fe69b4c006ae9752b31f962251353ea/tumblr_inline_pq76hiqBKP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71a35b15b9eaa06d2f4d8d5e880e288e/tumblr_inline_pq76faFlsn1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e69353bef741e1717f6c67f033363aa8/tumblr_inline_pq76lauzhg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e7dd28663a132a1a1c8db25dfe19715d/tumblr_inline_pq76kz4KBk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/48ce067e6f0d768363887b86384b759c/tumblr_inline_pq76lmaXQQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f7ef2c119da1bc3e1b7877e79cf5853/tumblr_inline_pq76kkkh0Q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8de23c04773b4e5f7ef5645beaf14eab/tumblr_inline_pq76kpwlGW1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fed5970ca508dbe7e4e61b1223b1381a/tumblr_inline_pq76lsT3041qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/72a0e62b07c55e2de574589ce86398b5/tumblr_inline_pq76khjMrp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/65f8566edce53459fd7b9a4bdfec2330/tumblr_inline_pq76l4c4w31qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4371b87a238813824666d4dffc1f0353/tumblr_inline_pq76lgsT7j1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8b985459456d093bb842dca1b5e739a/tumblr_inline_pq76fx456P1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2d34b12a73b11dce63f1cecf9e45d1c/tumblr_inline_pq76f83wf11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40a8214a787045503b7c4a5d891dd301/tumblr_inline_pq76j1OajP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a5d0be39c544dd2207948f4b85c62c53/tumblr_inline_pq76hjP43B1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/17552e062056d9a425021387cc0fb808/tumblr_inline_pq76hme1sO1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/54154d9a8595a94aaa42f2ec12d02cc7/tumblr_inline_pq76hpXjMk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ac821e781617906e89b1ec695cb0e9b9/tumblr_inline_pq76hr3PRR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/49af05a3a86d52c6cf6f64b813d40c27/tumblr_inline_pq76htwID81qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/38588e83bddaf19a8d0843a6eaa41bd7/tumblr_inline_pq76gvNJB91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/839491ae4adbdb63e6dd5772e49e551a/tumblr_inline_pq76e2Iib61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/23b2af3447bd6658226c453e9528c51f/tumblr_inline_pq76gnmHIQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd76a88d2a817038512603c1787d64e3/tumblr_inline_pq76gnqN841qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c528b69e8c2afd1bfca698198b58677/tumblr_inline_pq76gqiIQG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c3fa40561cc6a043601d509e758c6df/tumblr_inline_pq76gslWuk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2349e53a3cbf6d975ca3cea6717ae35/tumblr_inline_pq76gtWFsM1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2bb3df07f0e4c37521e8786c064fb011/tumblr_inline_pq76gwwDdi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef996d4ba75874b2c8293b7138000d49/tumblr_inline_pq76gxdJdd1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cfbb03518c2b9a10e50b9b158dcf96ef/tumblr_inline_pq76f7VAVR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0b154e88a5ab366be0ac1f2485f9705/tumblr_inline_pq76fumUg61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/99033920dd13e532aa030b10d9f2a254/tumblr_inline_pq76fu4Cnp1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/851bb4b0afb68ad8bdabe3feca38b5fd/tumblr_inline_pq76fzRhTu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/41322da3b79327d33b9ef91092b6a427/tumblr_inline_pq76g11l6S1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a12a474960a19de993ad90ad08d6533/tumblr_inline_pq7

The store has an impressive selection covering a range of styles, from Japanese workwear to Neapolitan tailoring to contemporary minimalism. But a lot of the stuff comes together in a way that works for guys who appreciate classics without wanting to look like they’re in repro, as well as contemporary clothes without seeming overly trendy. Greg, the shop’s founder, used to work as a senior investment banker at UBS, where he had to wear a coat-and-tie. I appreciate that he has a better eye for tailoring than more casual shops, but also a more stylish take on casualwear than most traditional clothiers. \n\nFor the next three days, they’re holding an early spring sale, where you can take 20% off any full-priced item with the checkout code SPRING20. [They also have some deeply discounted stragglers left in their winter sale section](https://bit.ly/2v68MCF)\n, although the code doesn’t stack. Here are five things that I think are particularly notable right now: \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d3b1d2beaeddaee2814224a0665721f2/tumblr_inline_ppytzfkPF61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**[EIDOS TONAL SEERSUCKER SUITS](https://bit.ly/2VLGTLO)\n**\n\nAntonio Ciongoli is no longer designing for Eidos, but a small selection of his patterns, cuts, and styles are available at No Man Walks Alone for one last season. I really like the two tonal seersucker suits this spring, [which are available in olive green and a narrower striped tan](https://bit.ly/2GmyGZi)\n (note, the jackets and trousers are sold separately). Traditional seersucker, in its blue-and-white color combination, can conjure up old-time-y ideas of Southern gentility — men chomping on fat cigars and cucumber sandwiches, swilling their mint juleps while attending lawn parties. I think the style has a certain charm, but if it feels too traditional for you, these have all the cool-wearing effect of seersucker in more modern form. Either suit would look great with a slightly textured or patterned shirt, such as a crinkly linen or bolder striped cotton. [You won’t look as awesome as Tony Sylvester above,](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvorWtQAVhU/)\n but you can pretend you do.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e68ffdcee2d52dc738dad15ff0f645dd/tumblr_inline_ppwycb8OzR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**BLURHMS GRAPHIC TEE**](https://bit.ly/2Uxk1TM)\n\nLook, I know there’s no way to reasonably justify a $100+ t-shirt (this one is $108, even with the discount code). Some of what you’re paying for is the fact that this was made in Japan, where wages are higher, and the shirt is constructed from an impressively soft, long-staple cotton that has a bit of heft. The graphic, which is a photo of a man reading a newspaper in a park, is also nicely printed, but at the end of the day, a t-shirt is a t-shirt.\n\nThat said, I bought this last week at full price (well, with the 10% off coupon No Man Walks Alone offers to readers of this site – code DWW10). The shirt feels a bit more substantial than your average upscale t-shirt, and the sepia-toned graphic goes well with washed blue chore coats and black leather jackets. Graphic t-shirts have gotten a bad rap over the years, not undeserved, but the right one can also look great in the right context. [I prefer the muted sepia-tones in this print](https://bit.ly/2Uxk1TM)\n, but No Man Walks Alone also has a more [colorful version of a woman staring down a street at sunset](https://bit.ly/2VJx01h)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3b22a29eacf75be373dfc101a74fbf1b/tumblr_inline_ppwymhnaX91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**CHAMULA’S “CANCUN” HUARCHES**](https://bit.ly/2YPiM0B)\n\nHuaraches are a traditional Mexican style of sandals. They’re mostly worn by indigenous Mexicans and those in the rural locales, but starting in the 1960s, they also became part of the uniform of California hippies and surfers. The Beach Boys even sung about them in their 1964 hit “Surfin’ USA.” The reasons for their appeal are obvious: cheap, breathable, and more versatile than flip-flops, they go well with the kind of clothes you want to wear when it’s scorching hot (e.g. stuff from Dana Lee, loose pants, trim shorts, camp collars, and yes, vacation shirts).\n\nFor me, Chamula’s version ticks all the right boxes. They’re nicely affordable at $125 (or $100 with the current promotion). They’re lightweight but also constructed from full grain, vegetable-tanned leather. And they’re produced in a Mexican workshop by people who traditionally engage in these crafts (which gives the shoes some authenticity and provenance). These can be a way to make a simple, shirt-and-pants summer outfit more interesting when it’s too hot for outerwear. Available in [dark brown](https://bit.ly/2YPiM0B)\n and [tan](https://bit.ly/2UVa9CO)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/54cd00cf01280b53aedcf004da2923c8/tumblr_inline_ppytqyCQ3K1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**SUEDE VALSTARINO**](https://bit.ly/2X8amjd)\n\n[When I interviewed costume designer Keri Langerman a few weeks ago](https://putthison.com/dress-for-a-role-style-lessons-from-a-costume-designer/)\n, I asked her if she has any go-tos when dressing actors — certain things she finds works for any man regardless of their fitness or age. She struggled to come up with staples, instead noted that she tries to stay true to the script and dress each character uniquely. That said, she also said that she thinks anyone can look good in a Valstarino, which was the signature jacket [Jude Law wore for his role as a music manager in the film _Vox Lux_](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrcwtdBlusn/)\n.\n\nIf you’ve been reading menswear blogs for any amount of time, you’re probably familiar with the Valstarino. It’s a citified, Italian version of the American A-1 flight jacket — a bomber style with a stand-up knitted collar and button front. It first became popular with online audiences twelve years ago when [Italian fashion editor Stefano Tonchi was pictured wearing one at The Sartorialist](http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/at-the-tuileries-mr-stefano-tonchi/)\n. These days, it’s often worn by guys who are looking for dressed-down alternatives to sport coats. The style goes well with jeans or tailored trousers, sneakers or casual leather shoes, button-up shirts or sweaters. [Simon Crompton has a good post on how to wear the style](https://www.permanentstyle.com/2017/12/a-casual-capsule-the-valstarino-jacket-three-ways.html)\n. In brown, it feels classic, while in more monochromic ensembles, it can be very contemporary.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb136c54ee16964b71cc83050d20b3a6/tumblr_inline_ppwyb4LQmg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**INIS MEAIN LINEN SWEATER**](https://bit.ly/2KAdKlM)\n\nLinen knitwear sounds like a contradiction — who needs an airy sweater? But I find linen knits are a great way to add a bit of texture to an otherwise plainer ensemble, as well as keep to a layered look without overheating. The slightly slubby knit can be worn over a t-shirt or button-down, and then paired with cotton trousers and leather loafers for a casual look. You can also layer a linen sweater under lightweight outerwear, such as a hemp field jacket or stonewashed Harrington. Since they wear cooler and fresher than their merino or cotton counterparts, I find they’re ideal for those slightly chilly, summer evenings, or early spring days that still have a hint of winter.\n\n[My favorite linen knits are from Inis Meain](https://bit.ly/2De8DSd)\n, which are made from specially produced Italian yarns spun from Irish linen. They have a thick, dry hand, and most importantly, a slight spring-back quality. Whereas other linen knits hang limp and lose shape easily, Inis Meain’s behave like your best cashmere and merinos. These sweaters have a bit of “body” when worn, and their banded hems and cuffs don’t stretch out after a day’s wear. When the weather gets warm, you can push those sleeves up without worrying if they’ll end up looking like the legs on bell-bottom trousers. No Man Walks Alone has them in the two most useful colors: [blueberry](https://bit.ly/2KAdKlM)\n and [marled gray](https://bit.ly/2IkkLoL)\n.

The store has an impressive selection covering a range of styles, from Japanese workwear to Neapolitan tailoring to contemporary minimalism. But a lot of the stuff comes together in a way that works for guys who appreciate classics without wanting to look like they’re in repro, as well as contemporary clothes without seeming overly trendy. Greg, the shop’s founder, used to work as a senior investment banker at UBS, where he had to wear a coat-and-tie. I appreciate that he has a better eye for tailoring than more casual shops, but also a more stylish take on casualwear than most traditional clothiers. \n\nFor the next three days, they’re holding an early spring sale, where you can take 20% off any full-priced item with the checkout code SPRING20. [They also have some deeply discounted stragglers left in their winter sale section](https://bit.ly/2v68MCF)\n, although the code doesn’t stack. Here are five things that I think are particularly notable right now: \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d3b1d2beaeddaee2814224a0665721f2/tumblr_inline_ppytzfkPF61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**[EIDOS TONAL SEERSUCKER SUITS](https://bit.ly/2VLGTLO)\n**\n\nAntonio Ciongoli is no longer designing for Eidos, but a small selection of his patterns, cuts, and styles are available at No Man Walks Alone for one last season. I really like the two tonal seersucker suits this spring, [which are available in olive green and a narrower striped tan](https://bit.ly/2GmyGZi)\n (note, the jackets and trousers are sold separately). Traditional seersucker, in its blue-and-white color combination, can conjure up old-time-y ideas of Southern gentility — men chomping on fat cigars and cucumber sandwiches, swilling their mint juleps while attending lawn parties. I think the style has a certain charm, but if it feels too traditional for you, these have all the cool-wearing effect of seersucker in more modern form. Either suit would look great with a slightly textured or patterned shirt, such as a crinkly linen or bolder striped cotton. [You won’t look as awesome as Tony Sylvester above,](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvorWtQAVhU/)\n but you can pretend you do.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e68ffdcee2d52dc738dad15ff0f645dd/tumblr_inline_ppwycb8OzR1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**BLURHMS GRAPHIC TEE**](https://bit.ly/2Uxk1TM)\n\nLook, I know there’s no way to reasonably justify a $100+ t-shirt (this one is $108, even with the discount code). Some of what you’re paying for is the fact that this was made in Japan, where wages are higher, and the shirt is constructed from an impressively soft, long-staple cotton that has a bit of heft. The graphic, which is a photo of a man reading a newspaper in a park, is also nicely printed, but at the end of the day, a t-shirt is a t-shirt.\n\nThat said, I bought this last week at full price (well, with the 10% off coupon No Man Walks Alone offers to readers of this site – code DWW10). The shirt feels a bit more substantial than your average upscale t-shirt, and the sepia-toned graphic goes well with washed blue chore coats and black leather jackets. Graphic t-shirts have gotten a bad rap over the years, not undeserved, but the right one can also look great in the right context. [I prefer the muted sepia-tones in this print](https://bit.ly/2Uxk1TM)\n, but No Man Walks Alone also has a more [colorful version of a woman staring down a street at sunset](https://bit.ly/2VJx01h)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3b22a29eacf75be373dfc101a74fbf1b/tumblr_inline_ppwymhnaX91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**CHAMULA’S “CANCUN” HUARCHES**](https://bit.ly/2YPiM0B)\n\nHuaraches are a traditional Mexican style of sandals. They’re mostly worn by indigenous Mexicans and those in the rural locales, but starting in the 1960s, they also became part of the uniform of California hippies and surfers. The Beach Boys even sung about them in their 1964 hit “Surfin’ USA.” The reasons for their appeal are obvious: cheap, breathable, and more versatile than flip-flops, they go well with the kind of clothes you want to wear when it’s scorching hot (e.g. stuff from Dana Lee, loose pants, trim shorts, camp collars, and yes, vacation shirts).\n\nFor me, Chamula’s version ticks all the right boxes. They’re nicely affordable at $125 (or $100 with the current promotion). They’re lightweight but also constructed from full grain, vegetable-tanned leather. And they’re produced in a Mexican workshop by people who traditionally engage in these crafts (which gives the shoes some authenticity and provenance). These can be a way to make a simple, shirt-and-pants summer outfit more interesting when it’s too hot for outerwear. Available in [dark brown](https://bit.ly/2YPiM0B)\n and [tan](https://bit.ly/2UVa9CO)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/54cd00cf01280b53aedcf004da2923c8/tumblr_inline_ppytqyCQ3K1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**SUEDE VALSTARINO**](https://bit.ly/2X8amjd)\n\n[When I interviewed costume designer Keri Langerman a few weeks ago](https://putthison.com/dress-for-a-role-style-lessons-from-a-costume-designer/)\n, I asked her if she has any go-tos when dressing actors — certain things she finds works for any man regardless of their fitness or age. She struggled to come up with staples, instead noted that she tries to stay true to the script and dress each character uniquely. That said, she also said that she thinks anyone can look good in a Valstarino, which was the signature jacket [Jude Law wore for his role as a music manager in the film _Vox Lux_](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrcwtdBlusn/)\n.\n\nIf you’ve been reading menswear blogs for any amount of time, you’re probably familiar with the Valstarino. It’s a citified, Italian version of the American A-1 flight jacket — a bomber style with a stand-up knitted collar and button front. It first became popular with online audiences twelve years ago when [Italian fashion editor Stefano Tonchi was pictured wearing one at The Sartorialist](http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/at-the-tuileries-mr-stefano-tonchi/)\n. These days, it’s often worn by guys who are looking for dressed-down alternatives to sport coats. The style goes well with jeans or tailored trousers, sneakers or casual leather shoes, button-up shirts or sweaters. [Simon Crompton has a good post on how to wear the style](https://www.permanentstyle.com/2017/12/a-casual-capsule-the-valstarino-jacket-three-ways.html)\n. In brown, it feels classic, while in more monochromic ensembles, it can be very contemporary.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb136c54ee16964b71cc83050d20b3a6/tumblr_inline_ppwyb4LQmg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[**INIS MEAIN LINEN SWEATER**](https://bit.ly/2KAdKlM)\n\nLinen knitwear sounds like a contradiction — who needs an airy sweater? But I find linen knits are a great way to add a bit of texture to an otherwise plainer ensemble, as well as keep to a layered look without overheating. The slightly slubby knit can be worn over a t-shirt or button-down, and then paired with cotton trousers and leather loafers for a casual look. You can also layer a linen sweater under lightweight outerwear, such as a hemp field jacket or stonewashed Harrington. Since they wear cooler and fresher than their merino or cotton counterparts, I find they’re ideal for those slightly chilly, summer evenings, or early spring days that still have a hint of winter.\n\n[My favorite linen knits are from Inis Meain](https://bit.ly/2De8DSd)\n, which are made from specially produced Italian yarns spun from Irish linen. They have a thick, dry hand, and most importantly, a slight spring-back quality. Whereas other linen knits hang limp and lose shape easily, Inis Meain’s behave like your best cashmere and merinos. These sweaters have a bit of “body” when worn, and their banded hems and cuffs don’t stretch out after a day’s wear. When the weather gets warm, you can push those sleeves up without worrying if they’ll end up looking like the legs on bell-bottom trousers.

Take 30% off any order with the checkout code GETHAPPY. The code applies to both new arrivals and the sale section, although only new arrivals are returnable for a full refund (the website’s return policy suggests otherwise, but I called Unionmade’s store in San Francisco to clarify). \n\nUnionmade is a great shop for workwear, heritage brands, and hard-to-find Japanese imports. They carry everything from Levi’s to Deveaux, but the clothes come together in a way that can be roughly described as a semi-classic, casual West Coast aesthetic. There are slim-straight jeans for guys who normally wear sport coats, as well as a huge selection of casualwear drawing from militaria, workwear, and neo-retro outdoor gear.  Here are five things I think are particularly worth a look:\n\n**[LVC 1947 501s:](https://bit.ly/2I7Ikkz)\n** Levi’s 501s has gone through a number of iterations over the years. The 1947 edition was the first one produced after the end of WWII, and as a result, it featured details that were previously lost due to wartime rationing measures. The watch pockets were made with rivets, and the back pockets regained their arcuate lines (those double needle, “batwing” stitches). It was also made with a classic slim-straight cut – slimmer than the company’s current version of the 501, but with a bit more room in the leg and slightly higher rise than many slim-fit jeans today. If you’re looking for a slim-straight jean that can be worn with workwear and sport coats, you could hardly do better.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff91bd7280fe9717d8048b626dc6d86c/tumblr_inline_ppmts9LLBb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**[Carhartt WIP Work Pants:](https://bit.ly/2G2IpCN)** You definitely won’t look as good as Daniel Day-Lewis in these [double-knee work pants](https://bit.ly/2G2IpCN)\n. Or even as good as [Haley at Man Repeller](https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/03/daniel-day-lewis-street-style.html)\n, who tried to look like DDL.

A few months ago, [when these photos came out](https://garage.vice.com/en_us/article/mbyp34/daniel-day-lewis-menswear-twitter)\n, the internet went crazy over DDL’s combo involving a popped collar work jacket with a watch cap, thick-rimmed glasses, and these work pants. [After more photos of him wearing the same work pants surfaced](https://cache.mrporter.com/images/journal/ac4f8232-d987-4663-881c-4f2a4746caab/w1000_q65.jpg)\n, Mr. Porter started carrying the model (now sold out, [but available in single knee form](https://rstyle.me/+29_QzQ6BXQmG7HMF7EoH1g)\n). Admittedly, on a younger figure, this is the uniform of a Bushwick bartender or an “NYU creative writing major with an ethnomusicology concentration.” But it also looks achingly cool and the pieces refreshingly affordable. With the Unionmade promotion, they’re barely over $100.\n\n**[Lady White’s T-Shirts:](https://bit.ly/2OZH43I)** Why would anyone pay so much for a t-shirt? Lady White’s are knitted from a soft but sturdy 6oz jersey cotton in Los Angeles. Their white, unbleached cotton has a subtle slub, and the fabric holds up well in the wash. The t-shirts also fit well with just a hint of vintage appeal without being as unforgiving as LVC’s tees. I prefer their [Clark model](https://bit.ly/2Kjug9A)\n, which features a Browns Beach vest-inspired chest pocket, but these plain tees are also great.  \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/87679622114e7b176a78966f24b7fbd8/tumblr_inline_ppnnu6esuh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**[Work Jackets:](https://bit.ly/2I9dwzJ)** Unionmade has some wonderful workwear-inspired jackets this spring. [Arpenteur’s chore coats](https://bit.ly/2OUnaaf)\n are exceedingly simple — just a button-front closure with a fold-down collar and couple of pockets. But the French style goes well with jeans, chinos, and chambray work shirt, and is the sort of grab-and-go style that I often find I reach for when running out the door on short time. [Grei’s raw denim jacket](https://bit.ly/2Ijw8wl)\n has a shorter, boxier fit that I think lends a more interesting silhouette. And then there are the [two Eastlogue jackets](https://bit.ly/2D0UJm8)\n you see above, which are imported from South Korea. [The M70 parka looks especially handsome](https://bit.ly/2Kks1ml)\n and is made from a lightweight, tear-resistant Cordura fabric. Plus, who couldn’t use another piece of olive green outerwear?\n\n**[Camp Collar Shirts:](https://bit.ly/2Kkl44Q)** I love oxford-cloth button-downs, but they do better with a jacket than worn on their own. When paired with just chinos or tailored trousers, they swing a little too close to business casual for my taste. So when it’s too hot for outerwear, I like camp collar shirts for their more distinctive style. Unionmade has some nice ones this season from [Arpenteur](https://bit.ly/2OUnaaf)\n, [Sage de Cret,](https://bit.ly/2G1MaYU)\n and [Hartford](https://bit.ly/2VvN1HR)\n.

The store, which is located just a few blocks from the Arno River, has long been known for its personalized service and quality clothing. Inside were luxurious cashmere knits from Fedeli and Hawick; tastefully patterned ties from Mattabisch and Tie Your Tie; and natural-shouldered sport coats from Sartorio Napoli and Orazio Luciano. \n\nThe store’s main draw, however, has always been the man behind the counter. Simone has exceptional taste and an easy-going style, and he dresses with a natural sophistication that arguably can’t be taught. He has what antique collectors call The Eye, which is that unteachable and irrevocable power to discern art from trash, real from fake, inspired from derivative. “Most of the great dressers I know tend to dismiss complaints such as ‘your sleeve is a quarter-inch too short,’” [David Isle once wrote of The Eye](https://bit.ly/2CypAX1)\n. “It’s not that they don’t care about these details. It’s that they have developed the ability to look at an outfit holistically, rather than in parts. They have The Eye. \\[…\\] The legend of The Eye would have it that this talent cannot be learned.” Still, that hasn’t stopped many men from trying. Over the years, men from around the world have come to Frasi not only to shop, but also to pick up a few lessons from Simone on how they can wear clothes in such a carefree but considered manner. \n\nUnfortunately, the store is now closing, going the way of [Louis Boston](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/01/09/louis-boston-close-after-more-than-years/Awhfe7HCF1gORkcYzBkPEI/story.html)\n and [Harvard Square’s J. Press](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/8/7/j-press-closing/)\n. While wrapped in a brown checked tweed and duo-toned scarf, Simone remained composed throughout his Facebook video, but was also visibly choked up. “This is a peculiar message for you all. It’s a thank you message for everyone who came to meet me, who came here to my shop, a shop that’s like a home to me,” he started. “To all those people, I want to say thank you for giving me your trust and for letting me create a connection with you, for a few minutes or a few years, so that I could give you a tool for you to express your personality. Thank you for letting me grow and express my creativity. Thank you for your kindness. This, however, is a peculiar thank you message because it’s also a goodbye. A part of my life is coming to an end, a part that includes my profession. My shop here in Florence is closing. I truly hope we can meet again on some future project because it has all been really beautiful.” [His last Instagram post is of two people hugging](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu_ox0fFsbB/)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c97a3c9c966f984ec9442be0638fc933/tumblr_inline_pon5ovItNr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nFrasi is the kind of old-school brick-and-mortar that existed before the internet. The store was a complete manifestation of the clothier behind it. The colorful walls were decorated with Simone’s paintings; the racks replete with English-Italian clothes that reflected his unique point-of-view. And while the store itself had little internet presence, Simone towered over the online men’s style scene. He gained a bit of stardom through street style sites such as [The Sartorialist](http://thesartorialist.com/tag/simone/)\n, where Scott Schuman documented his sense of dress alongside figures such as Luciano Barbera, Luca Rubinacci, and Yukio Akamine. During the late-aughts, those photographs circulated through the internet, helping to create a larger and more engaged online audience for classic men’s style.\n\nTo be sure, street style photography is nothing new. In the early 20th century, French lace and fabric houses commissioned work from the Seeberger brothers, who were sent to the Grand Prix horseracing tracks at Longchamp, Chantilly, and Deauville to photograph fashionable women. _Vogue_ and _Harper’s Bazaar_, similarly, have long featured well-heeled and well-dressed socialites grazing on snacks at Manhattan parties. But street style photography in its modern form is unique in how it’s created mini-celebrities that have been able to shape global taste through rapid reblogging and social media. If Simone’s style – with its soft-shouldered jackets and double-pleated trousers – doesn’t seem novel to you, it’s only because thousands of men have since copied the look (although, I think, he still wears it best). \n\n“Simone is a true original,” says [BRIO founder George Wang](https://www.instagram.com/beijing1980/)\n, who cites Simone as both a mentor and friend. “His face was the content that fueled the growth of menswear street photography and social media. While I’m sure he has his own style references, I can guarantee he made zero fashion choices based on Instagram photos. That alone sets him apart from the rest of us. His store is a genuine reflection of his own style as well as the city of Florence itself. An authentic experience such as this is becoming extinct.”\n\nSimone’s influence can be felt in how he made tailoring feel relevant and relatable for a younger generation of men, while never giving up the cinematic élan that makes classic style so appealing in the first place. [George put it well on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu6V4ZChDLl/)\n, where he said Simone showed how cool one can look in clothes once considered to be “old mannish.” By today’s standards, and even more so in the late-aughts when he was first photographed, his style is profoundly traditional – his jackets are long and full-bodied, his lapels slightly wide, and his high-rise, double-pleated trousers are full enough to cover more than his shoes’ openings. And yet, there’s something sporty and impossibly cool about his appearance. His taste, a truer representation of classic Italian style than most Continental brands, has proven to be a harbinger for where men’s style would go since he [first appeared at The Sartorialist in 2008](http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/here-comes-the-storm-hello-from-florence/)\n. Ironic then that the man who inspired so many Italian-flavored menswear upstarts wasn’t able to financially make it himself.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f6e7f9e917ce9dbcbdb187eaf4c84318/tumblr_inline_poqejhod8w1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n“He influenced so many people through personal interactions or by simply putting himself out there to be seen, but he never received any compensation for the value he brought to classic menswear or Italian style,” says George. “He kept his doors open to flows of people who were only there to chit chat or take photos, so they could generate online traffic for their own agenda. Being a generous soul, he was probably OK with all that, but as an onlooker, it makes me sad that his store is now closing. He has been a huge influence on my own sense of aesthetics and my business philosophy, so the loss of Frasi feels like a bit of BRIO has also been lost. Simone’s store is just who he is and how he likes things, perhaps this is why he couldn’t make his business work, but it’s sad that businesses suffer for being unique and authentic.”\n\n**SUPPORT STORES THAT ADD VALUE TO YOUR LIFE**\n\nFrasi didn’t have any e-commerce to speak of – to buy anything, you had to visit the brick-and-mortar in Florence. But its closure is an opportunity to talk about something I’ve been thinking about for a while: the importance of supporting companies that add value to your life, even if those benefits aren’t fully captured in the products and services you’re receiving. \n\nThe market has always struggled to fully capture what economists call externalities – the side effects of a commercial activity that affects other parties without being fully reflected in the cost of the goods or services themselves. In Econ 101 classes, the textbook example is pollution. If left unregulated, a company can offload the cost of pollution onto nearby residents, rather than having it reflected in the price of their products. \n\nBut there are also positive externalities. In my neighborhood, for example, there are mom-and-pop run grocery stores, exciting bars and restaurants, small hardware shops, and other boutique businesses. The commercial landscape here makes for a much more pleasant walking experience than if I were to live near big-box retailers and fast food eateries. However, these companies are facing stiff competition from cutthroat online retailers such as Amazon, who can always shave off a few pennies to gain market share, as well as overseas businesses who face different cost structures. The junction of wildly fluctuating exchange rates, import and export taxes, and differing legal requirements means retailers aren’t always playing on an even field. Add to this showrooming – the ability of consumers to try on clothes at a local store, then shop online at a lower price – and you can see how brick-and-mortars struggle to fully capitalize on the value they offer. People genuinely want local boutiques, walkable neighborhoods, and lasting quality, but the market fails to supply these things because online retailers are able to exploit the desirable externalities created by brick-and-mortar businesses.  \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ffe3fd4c638dac8445857fcc0faf7a0b/tumblr_inline_pon5za6Eac1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nIf you think of the online men’s style community as a neighborhood, you can see the same dynamic. High-touch businesses don’t just compete on price, they do the hard work of bringing new people into a market, educating them on what’s “good,” and suggesting ways to wear things. They give inspiration through social media and lookbooks; they introduce consumers to new brands and products. More than just engaging in price arbitrage, good retailers help create the meaning that fills our lives. See how Simone made classic Italian tailoring a bit more relatable for a younger demographic. Or how [Self Edge](https://bit.ly/2ESkypZ)\n recontextualized Good Art’s jewelry for the workwear crowd. Or how [Union](https://store.unionlosangeles.com/)\n helped transform Visvim and Thom Browne into semi-streetwear brands. \n\nThe internet, however, has made it infinitely easier to comparison shop, so that you can take the inspiration and information gained from one business and spend your money elsewhere. There’s no reasonable way to stop this – and consumers should have the right to spend their money where they want. But it’s important, I think, to recognize that there are two types of businesses: high-touch companies that add value to a community, and those that merely compete on price. The second can’t exist without the other. [Without Briain Goulet’s Youtube videos on fountain pens](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheInkNouveau/videos)\n, for example, consumers wouldn’t know how to sort through the piles of Pilot Vanishing Points and Platinum #3776 Century pens on Amazon. In a YouTube video on why the fountain pen market sees dramatically different prices for the same items, [Brian of The Goulet Pen Company says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk_Cv5kxV9M)\n: \n\n> When you’re shopping online, you’re not necessarily thinking ‘oh they’re in a different country, facing different regulations, dealing all kinds of different things.’ You’re just comparing one website to another, thinking ‘I want my stuff, give me the lowest price.’ I totally understand because I do the same thing. But I just want people to understand what they’re doing when they’re voting with their dollar – you’re supporting certain ways of doing business. Yes, some Japanese sellers are able to offer a lower price. Part of this is because they don’t have their own website; they’re selling through Amazon and eBay. Of course, they have to give a cut of those profits, but they’re not the ones who are out there promoting these items. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/85f1d578b91d092f12477af26b3854aa/tumblr_inline_p6zo9tM5Xl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n> If you don’t already have an awareness and desire to shop for these products, they would not be able to sell them to you. Where are you getting that awareness? From someone who’s done the legwork to educate, promote, discuss, research, etc. There’s nothing wrong with selling on Amazon or eBay, but if that’s all there was, you wouldn’t have a clue what you’re buying because those companies’ short product descriptions make for crapshoot purchases. As a retailer, I try to earn my pay by putting out reliable information, teaching people about products, and adding value to their lives, so people see a reason to support me. As fun as these videos are for me to produce, they take a lot of time and energy. If I didn’t have the income to support this work, Goulet videos would go away. \n\nBrian’s work is unique in that no one is doing for the menswear market what [The Goulet Pen Company](https://www.gouletpens.com/)\n is doing for fountain pens, but the general idea is the same: it’s important to support companies that add value to your life; otherwise they disappear. Sometimes value can be about the relationship between an object and its price, but often it’s about those positive externalities that aren’t about the object or even its associated customer service. Some things I think you can do to support good work:\n\n**Think About Who Adds Value to Your Life:** This post isn’t about supporting specific kinds of businesses – small or large, family-owned or corporate – but rather any kind of company that adds value to your life. Maybe that’s about online content or walkable neighborhoods; perhaps it’s about a boutique that offers unique or authentic experiences. Anything that makes for a better day-to-day experience, even when you’re not shopping. Support those companies every once in a while with a purchase.\n\n**Shop Full Retail Where You Can:** I love a good deal as much as the next person, but businesses can’t sustain themselves at clearance prices. Despite popular misconceptions, most shops don’t set prices to clear the door at 70% off discounts. [Sole Collector has a good breakdown showing the cost structure on a pair of Nikes](https://solecollector.com/news/2014/12/how-much-it-costs-nike-to-make-a-100-shoe)\n, and the margins aren’t as fat as you may think. If you love a particular business, shop at full retail where you can. \n\n**Stop Gatekeeping:** Bruce Boyer put it well when he said that some men treat “dressing as though it were a blood sport, a competition rather than a celebration.” Men’s style can be such a personal thing, and classic style, in particular, is so laden with rules, it’s easy to become bitter about how other people are wearing clothes. But in the end, negativity just hurts those businesses we wish to support – it makes the field smaller and less friendly to outsiders. Instead, make the community open and welcoming, encourage people to take an interest. Rather than making the field seem impossibly impenetrable, full of only expensive items that no one can afford, let people develop their style at their own pace. Today’s Ecco wearer may be tomorrow’s Allen Edmonds’ customer, who in turn one day may shop at Crockett & Jones. \n\n**Proselytize:** Similarly, instead of criticizing things for being ersatz, promote what you think is good and genuine. Post stuff on Facebook; tag products on Instagram; and share your joy with others. Tell others about good companies and products. Perhaps you like a particular retailer’s authenticity or a brand’s lookbooks, but can’t afford any of their wares. Sharing is caring though, and best of all, it’s free. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f18e8273f80e49ea105542d6accf1d0c/tumblr_inline_pon5ppjfLX1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/634589f2fef8965f5849c98e4271fd0c/tumblr_inline_pon5pxabhS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09c28c348354f5b4af704a411b98d06a/tumblr_inline_pon5poHV8S1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cda73c9e223e0003fa3163e4480b29d2/tumblr_inline_pon5q1gjCc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/618cd496abc02645febf8aad8c1b8a35/tumblr_inline_pon5py1p701qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d2b848a2d5213672d44f51ced94532b/tumblr_inline_pon5pnh6NY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fa429c795a43e864a469af5b198a0be4/tumblr_inline_pon5osCrG41qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2c957e128ec00244a1b67ff52a497320/tumblr_inline_pon5pexukD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e9950a5f9ac18f9418d321d357d2e126/tumblr_inline_pon5p6UFhb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3709f962214040dee8833c52c646609/tumblr_inline_pon5pn17mT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e826727363f6bd008b9c299cf1da75e2/tumblr_inline_pon5pzqnRu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/03a00339f5d518f3935b3bca7562696f/tumblr_inline_pon5osoOOY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3a739e5baef9cf7a392fc216b12f3e28/tumblr_inline_pon5q3yiaL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c1cc8f1f9940cb70cfad8c6fe6bd764/tumblr_inline_pon5p7gCoq1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d04023689dc1cbd2c589759d43910a9/tumblr_inline_pon5pqdhly1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a2ff17d946ac661b038ddcff8fbfcf9/tumblr_inline_pon5paF9RZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/41fccfb9f6ef46d4e640a9b3c7623a3a/tumblr_inline_pon5prwraK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fdb188e915cedddb9de71fcbb9415fe5/tumblr_inline_pon5ouU7SS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f0d489cf1cbd4dde319afecdbaef8ca/tumblr_inline_pon5psAD9Q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/22582efb6d032578d2a3fceb77a85ed5/tumblr_inline_pon5pbGWpa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e877fea0f74e9ade59fcd6aeb03239d/tumblr_inline_pon5pcWyol1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/107157e51bde4c6767c2c5617ce4ed1c/tumblr_inline_pon5pduKRc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5f574e700e32ea1651024de9b2de5fc2/tumblr_inline_pon5ox4kJb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ccf60f02939199689bfffb8ec7f39dc/tumblr_inline_pon5owiSLr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1d976b5ee0cf080f98517fa612efe72a/tumblr_inline_pon5pfMORK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[In a bittersweet address on Facebook last week](https://www.facebook.com/simonerighifrasi/videos/2557937344279787/)\n, Simone Righi of Frasi told his followers he’s shuttering his menswear boutique in Florence, Italy. The store, which is located just a few blocks from the Arno River, has long been known for its personalized service and quality clothing. Inside were luxurious cashmere knits from Fedeli and Hawick; tastefully patterned ties from Mattabisch and Tie Your Tie; and natural-shouldered sport coats from Sartorio Napoli and Orazio Luciano. \n\nThe store’s main draw, however, has always been the man behind the counter. Simone has exceptional taste and an easy-going style, and he dresses with a natural sophistication that arguably can’t be taught. He has what antique collectors call The Eye, which is that unteachable and irrevocable power to discern art from trash, real from fake, inspired from derivative. “Most of the great dressers I know tend to dismiss complaints such as ‘your sleeve is a quarter-inch too short,’” [David Isle once wrote of The Eye](https://bit.ly/2CypAX1)\n. “It’s not that they don’t care about these details. It’s that they have developed the ability to look at an outfit holistically, rather than in parts. They have The Eye. \\[…\\] The legend of The Eye would have it that this talent cannot be learned.” Still, that hasn’t stopped many men from trying. Over the years, men from around the world have come to Frasi not only to shop, but also to pick up a few lessons from Simone on how they can wear clothes in such a carefree but considered manner. \n\nUnfortunately, the store is now closing, going the way of [Louis Boston](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/01/09/louis-boston-close-after-more-than-years/Awhfe7HCF1gORkcYzBkPEI/story.html)\n and [Harvard Square’s J. Press](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/8/7/j-press-closing/)\n. While wrapped in a brown checked tweed and duo-toned scarf, Simone remained composed throughout his Facebook video, but was also visibly choked up. “This is a peculiar message for you all. It’s a thank you message for everyone who came to meet me, who came here to my shop, a shop that’s like a home to me,” he started. “To all those people, I want to say thank you for giving me your trust and for letting me create a connection with you, for a few minutes or a few years, so that I could give you a tool for you to express your personality. Thank you for letting me grow and express my creativity. Thank you for your kindness. This, however, is a peculiar thank you message because it’s also a goodbye. A part of my life is coming to an end, a part that includes my profession. My shop here in Florence is closing. I truly hope we can meet again on some future project because it has all been really beautiful.” [His last Instagram post is of two people hugging](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu_ox0fFsbB/)\n. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c97a3c9c966f984ec9442be0638fc933/tumblr_inline_pon5ovItNr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nFrasi is the kind of old-school brick-and-mortar that existed before the internet.

In the early 20th century, French lace and fabric houses commissioned work from the Seeberger brothers, who were sent to the Grand Prix horseracing tracks at Longchamp, Chantilly, and Deauville to photograph fashionable women. _Vogue_ and _Harper’s Bazaar_, similarly, have long featured well-heeled and well-dressed socialites grazing on snacks at Manhattan parties.

Of course, they have to give a cut of those profits, but they’re not the ones who are out there promoting these items. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/85f1d578b91d092f12477af26b3854aa/tumblr_inline_p6zo9tM5Xl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n> If you don’t already have an awareness and desire to shop for these products, they would not be able to sell them to you. Where are you getting that awareness? From someone who’s done the legwork to educate, promote, discuss, research, etc. There’s nothing wrong with selling on Amazon or eBay, but if that’s all there was, you wouldn’t have a clue what you’re buying because those companies’ short product descriptions make for crapshoot purchases. As a retailer, I try to earn my pay by putting out reliable information, teaching people about products, and adding value to their lives, so people see a reason to support me. As fun as these videos are for me to produce, they take a lot of time and energy. If I didn’t have the income to support this work, Goulet videos would go away. \n\nBrian’s work is unique in that no one is doing for the menswear market what [The Goulet Pen Company](https://www.gouletpens.com/)\n is doing for fountain pens, but the general idea is the same: it’s important to support companies that add value to your life; otherwise they disappear. Sometimes value can be about the relationship between an object and its price, but often it’s about those positive externalities that aren’t about the object or even its associated customer service. Some things I think you can do to support good work:\n\n**Think About Who Adds Value to Your Life:** This post isn’t about supporting specific kinds of businesses – small or large, family-owned or corporate – but rather any kind of company that adds value to your life. Maybe that’s about online content or walkable neighborhoods; perhaps it’s about a boutique that offers unique or authentic experiences. Anything that makes for a better day-to-day experience, even when you’re not shopping. Support those companies every once in a while with a purchase.\n\n**Shop Full Retail Where You Can:** I love a good deal as much as the next person, but businesses can’t sustain themselves at clearance prices. Despite popular misconceptions, most shops don’t set prices to clear the door at 70% off discounts. [Sole Collector has a good breakdown showing the cost structure on a pair of Nikes](https://solecollector.com/news/2014/12/how-much-it-costs-nike-to-make-a-100-shoe)\n, and the margins aren’t as fat as you may think. If you love a particular business, shop at full retail where you can. \n\n**Stop Gatekeeping:** Bruce Boyer put it well when he said that some men treat “dressing as though it were a blood sport, a competition rather than a celebration.” Men’s style can be such a personal thing, and classic style, in particular, is so laden with rules, it’s easy to become bitter about how other people are wearing clothes. But in the end, negativity just hurts those businesses we wish to support – it makes the field smaller and less friendly to outsiders. Instead, make the community open and welcoming, encourage people to take an interest. Rather than making the field seem impossibly impenetrable, full of only expensive items that no one can afford, let people develop their style at their own pace. Today’s Ecco wearer may be tomorrow’s Allen Edmonds’ customer, who in turn one day may shop at Crockett & Jones. \n\n**Proselytize:** Similarly, instead of criticizing things for being ersatz, promote what you think is good and genuine. Post stuff on Facebook; tag products on Instagram; and share your joy with others. Tell others about good companies and products. Perhaps you like a particular retailer’s authenticity or a brand’s lookbooks, but can’t afford any of their wares. Sharing is caring though, and best of all, it’s free. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f18e8273f80e49ea105542d6accf1d0c/tumblr_inline_pon5ppjfLX1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/634589f2fef8965f5849c98e4271fd0c/tumblr_inline_pon5pxabhS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09c28c348354f5b4af704a411b98d06a/tumblr_inline_pon5poHV8S1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cda73c9e223e0003fa3163e4480b29d2/tumblr_inline_pon5q1gjCc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/618cd496abc02645febf8aad8c1b8a35/tumblr_inline_pon5py1p701qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d2b848a2d5213672d44f51ced94532b/tumblr_inline_pon5pnh6NY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fa429c795a43e864a469af5b198a0be4/tumblr_inline_pon5osCrG41qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2c957e128ec00244a1b67ff52a497320/tumblr_inline_pon5pexukD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e9950a5f9ac18f9418d321d357d2e126/tumblr_inline_pon5p6UFhb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3709f962214040dee8833c52c646609/tumblr_inline_pon5pn17mT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e826727363f6bd008b9c299cf1da75e2/tumblr_inline_pon5pzqnRu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/03a00339f5d518f3935b3bca7562696f/tumblr_inline_pon5osoOOY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3a739e5baef9cf7a392fc216b12f3e28/tumblr_inline_pon5q3yiaL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c1cc8f1f9940cb70cfad8c6fe6bd764/tumblr_inline_pon5p7gCoq1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d04023689dc1cbd2c589759d43910a9/tumblr_inline_pon5pqdhly1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a2ff17d946ac661b038ddcff8fbfcf9/tumblr_inline_pon5paF9RZ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/41fccfb9f6ef46d4e640a9b3c7623a3a/tumblr_inline_pon5prwraK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fdb188e915cedddb9de71fcbb9415fe5/tumblr_inline_pon5ouU7SS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f0d489cf1cbd4dde319afecdbaef8ca/tumblr_inline_pon5psAD9Q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/22582efb6d032578d2a3fceb77a85ed5/tumblr_inline_pon5pbGWpa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e877fea0f74e9ade59fcd6aeb03239d/tumblr_inline_pon5pcWyol1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/107157e51bde4c6767c2c5617ce4ed1c/tumblr_inline_pon5pduKRc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5f574e700e32ea1651024de9b2de5fc2/tumblr_inline_pon5ox4kJb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ccf60f02939199689bfffb8ec7f39dc/tumblr_inline_pon5owiSLr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"Support Stores That Bring You Value — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"Support Stores That Bring You Value — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"In a bittersweet address on Facebook last week, Simone Righi of Frasi told his followers he’s shuttering his menswear boutique in Florence, Italy.

The first was the sort of skinny lapeled, Mod-inspired tailoring that prevailed after _Mad Men_ debuted in 2007; the second was a sleek and colorful “metrosexual” style that was represented through _Queer Eye for the Straight Guy_. Those two looks dominated the editorial pages of _GQ_ and _Esquire_, who showed the before-and-after transformations of men who learned how to buy slimmer clothing – and get things made slimmer still through a local alterations tailor. \n\nToday, those transformations are running in the opposite direction. Silhouettes are filling out and dressing like a dad is coming back in. High-fashion boutiques now stock the kind of “sensible” clothes your father likely buys from Kohl’s: relaxed-fit jeans; vacation shirts; schlubby tennis shoes; tactical fanny packs; and pastel-colored, washed-cotton caps (“they’re soft, shapeless, and familiar – just like dad,” writes [Pete Anderson at Put This On](https://putthison.com/5-things-under-50-you-can-get-right-now-to-prep-your-wardrobe-for-spring/)\n). Mr. Porter even stocks the most fatherly of leg coverings this season: [zip-off cargo pants that convert into cargo shorts](https://rstyle.me/+j-hONEjMKTzx9IRXoSz0gw)\n, giving value-minded fathers a two-for-one (which is good since Mr. Porter’s version is a mind-boggling $1,000).\n\nYou can chalk some of this up to the fashion cycle. Once a look becomes popular, first adopters move on, thus swinging the pendulum in the other direction (fuller silhouettes give way to skinny silhouettes until the second collapses and fuller styles prevail again).

Fashion writers have suggested it’s connected to ‘90s nostalgia, a new appreciation for practicality, and simple fashion exhaustion. In his piece on the rise of dad style, _[Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/dad-style-is-now-in-fashion-yes-even-the-jeans-1519321402)_ [fashion editor Jacob Gallagher wrote](https://www.wsj.com/articles/dad-style-is-now-in-fashion-yes-even-the-jeans-1519321402)\n: “it can be a relief to opt out of the edgier style game. \\[…\\] Men’s fashion sped up its trend cycle, rapidly hurling skinny jeans and Chinoiserie bomber jackets at us. If keeping up has left you exhausted, dad style can be an exit ramp to a comfort zone of fleece jackets and dependable khakis, the sort you relied on in college. \\[…\\] Practical? Check. Comfortable? Definitely. I may already own it? Ideal.”\n\nAll those things, while true, miss one of the more interesting storylines here about how language intersects with fashion, helping to popularize a look through sound branding. To understand how, you have to go back to a little-known art collective named [K-Hole](http://khole.net)\n, which was made up of five friends who had recently graduated from RISD and Brown University. They were toiling away in New York City trying to find their way into art careers when, one day, one of them found a curious corporate artifact.\n\nThe object was a trend forecasting report, like the ones Trendwatching and Future Laboratory churn out to help corporations understand how cultural currents can impact their bottom line. And like many of those reports, it was full of intellectual claptraps, superficial sociological analysis, and overwrought language. “Equally amused and intrigued, the friends decided to cook up trend reports of their own – an art project that would mix parodies of consumerism with their personal observations about culture,” Danielle Sacks wrote of the group at _[Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/3045744/thats-a-total-k-hole-thing-to-do)\n_. “K-Hole started as an art project designed to comment on the corporate world. Then, through a series of unexpected developments, it turned into another player in the industry it once provoked.”\n\nIn the following two years, they released three trend forecasting reports. The first report was about “fragmoretation;” the second focused on “prolasticity.” Having invented the language to describe certain trends, however, the team also needed to earnestly describe the phenomena these words were meant to capture. These reports caught the attention of people in the art community, but they went mostly unnoticed in the broader business world. That is, until K-Hole was invited to speak at a design conference in London, where they were challenged to think about how youth culture might look in the future. That’s when they came up with their most successful neologism: normcore.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/14d705d977f91874d649cd5935b74e1e/tumblr_inline_po1pbtxlo51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc50f1939504c37b705bd0d0b51528cd/tumblr_inline_po1ozoqGql1qfex1b_540.png)\n\nAlmost immediately after K-Hole released their fourth report in late 2013, the term normcore went viral. _[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/fashion/normcore-fashion-movement-or-massive-in-joke.html)_ deconstructed the idea half-tongue-in-cheek, questioning whether news media organizations were falling for an internet meme that had turned into a massive in-joke. Normcore, they said, was a fashion movement in which “scruffy young urbanites swear off the tired street-style clichés of the last decade — skinny jeans, wallet chains, flannel shirts — in favor of a less-ironic (but still pretty ironic) embrace of bland, suburban anti-fashion attire. (See Jeans, mom. Sneakers, white). \\[…\\] Even so, the fundamental question — is normcore real? — remains a matter of debate, even among the people who foisted the term upon the world.”\n\n[_New York Magazine’s_ The Cut](https://www.thecut.com/2014/02/normcore-fashion-trend.html)\n wrote about the new urban camouflage. [HuffPost Live](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/06/normcore_n_4912788.html)\n held a discussion on the trend. [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2014/4/16/5613542/9-questions-youre-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-normcore)\n wrote a normcore explainer for normies. The term snowballed into headlines at _[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/feb/27/normcore-the-next-big-fashion-movement)\n_, _[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickhanlon/2014/03/16/normcore-disrupts-fashion-brand-identity)\n_, and _[Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/daily-news/2014/03/normcore-fashion)\n_, making it about more than fashion and extending it into the broader culture. Brands such as [The Gap](https://twitter.com/Gap/status/439091955645960192)\n and [Hanes](https://twitter.com/Hanes/status/454340597852012544)\n boasted of being OG normcore. The term almost won “Word of the Year for 2014” in the Oxford English Dictionary (it tied with bae, but lost to vape). Since its coining, [nearly 40,000 news stories](https://www.google.com/search?q=normcore&tbm=nws&cad=h)\n have been written about normcore. This was all before people outside of Brooklyn were even wearing the style as a fashion statement. It was trend reporting before a trend. \n\nThe weird thing about normcore is how much of its success hinged on linguistics, rather than aesthetics. K-Hole came up with the term to mean a kind of social adaptability – dressing like a dandy at Pitti Uomo is normcore, just as it would be to wear a mohawk at a punk show. Both allow the wearer to disappear into the crowd, recognizing that “normal” is totally contextual. “Normcore was about dropping the pretense and learning to throw themselves into, without detachment, whatever subcultures or activities they stumbled into, even if they were mainstream,” explained the _Times_. But as soon as the word was run through the cultural machine, it metastasized. Soon, it came to refer to a particular mallcore look – Jerry Seinfeld in his garment-dyed button-ups and stonewashed jeans; Steve Jobs in his clingy, black turtlenecks and gray New Balance runners. Normcore is a kind of studied unfashionableness for the fashionable. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/28108c388fea29f48f0d99fa4322f1d8/tumblr_inline_po2nk28SJl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nPart of normcore’s charm is how it doesn’t mean anything, which means it can be used for almost everything. The first half is norm, from normal; the second half is -core, meaning hardcore or extreme. The term is irresistible, puzzling, and fun. It baits people into conversations, enticing them to ask “is this normcore” or “am I fashionable now?” Like Marcel Duchamp’s urinal, it makes people reconsider what counts as stylish. It’s popularity also comes out of a poverty of language. [In a _British Vogue_ video exploring how fashion PR works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtaaPlgt-QI)\n, one of K-Hole’s founding members told Alexa Chueng_:_ \n\n> People needed more vocabulary for fashion. There weren’t many words to describe how people were dressing \\[“Fabulous?,” Chueng jokes\\]. Besides fabulous. The idea of a hipster had been totally exhausted, but in my opinion, one of the reasons why the word hipster went on for so long is because there were no new words to talk about how to dress in a certain way, to have personal style, or to think of yourself as cool. I think we came into a vacuum. \n\nDressing normcore started off as a joke until it wasn’t one. [In a Highsnobiety podcast](https://www.highsnobiety.com/podcasts/)\n on the etymology of fuccboi, Mary H.K. Choi talks about how fashion at the moment is defined by subversive humor, in-group winking, and memes. In 2014, shortly after K-Hole’s report was released, people were starting to get into the style as a joke, but then the aesthetic became a legitimate category. Louis Vuitton’s Kim Jones took the classic Patagonia Retro-X fleece jacket and made it lux. Birkenstocks aren’t just a fashion statement, they’ve got designer collaborations.\n\n> I think there’s something funny about what \\[Vetements\\] is able to pull off. That doesn’t mean I’m going to buy a DHL t-shirt, but I love the attitude with which it’s pulled off. I love that it feels like high-fashion trolling, which I think is always hysterical. It captures Franco Moschino’s attitude towards fashion. It shows how the people who follow these trends do it so slavishly. When there’s a spectacle like this and people buy into it, if you’re aware of what you’re doing when you buy into it, I think it becomes funny. There’s nothing more hysterical than if you bought one of those \\[Vetements\\] hoodies, put it on ice, and wore it right when it was coming out of style. \n\nIn the way the word spread like a brush fire across certain corners of the internet, normcore may be the first purely internet-created fashion trend. It’s also an example of sound branding – a strange intersection of linguistics and aesthetics, where the catchiness of a word turned the simple act of “being” into a fashionable act. Normcore is the precursor to every frump-chic style that has emerged since late 2013: dad style, gorpcore, Patagonia fleece, New Balances, track pants, fanny packs, bloated sneakers, and all things staid. For better or worse, it’s also made fashion more relatable. Whereas men’s fashion once pulled from the aspirational lifestyles of blue-blooded WASPs, Italian industrialists, and virtuous blue-collar workers, today’s icons are everyday people. One wonders if things could have turned out differently if the word wasn’t so irresistible. \n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2367fc7057c80c84e9cd1707b1f5981b/tumblr_inline_po0dqbvZgT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nIf you were just getting into menswear ten years ago, you likely updated your wardrobe in one of two directions.

If keeping up has left you exhausted, dad style can be an exit ramp to a comfort zone of fleece jackets and dependable khakis, the sort you relied on in college. \\[…\\] Practical? Check. Comfortable? Definitely. I may already own it? Ideal.”\n\nAll those things, while true, miss one of the more interesting storylines here about how language intersects with fashion, helping to popularize a look through sound branding. To understand how, you have to go back to a little-known art collective named [K-Hole](http://khole.net)\n, which was made up of five friends who had recently graduated from RISD and Brown University. They were toiling away in New York City trying to find their way into art careers when, one day, one of them found a curious corporate artifact.\n\nThe object was a trend forecasting report, like the ones Trendwatching and Future Laboratory churn out to help corporations understand how cultural currents can impact their bottom line. And like many of those reports, it was full of intellectual claptraps, superficial sociological analysis, and overwrought language. “Equally amused and intrigued, the friends decided to cook up trend reports of their own – an art project that would mix parodies of consumerism with their personal observations about culture,” Danielle Sacks wrote of the group at _[Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/3045744/thats-a-total-k-hole-thing-to-do)\n_. “K-Hole started as an art project designed to comment on the corporate world. Then, through a series of unexpected developments, it turned into another player in the industry it once provoked.”\n\nIn the following two years, they released three trend forecasting reports. The first report was about “fragmoretation;” the second focused on “prolasticity.” Having invented the language to describe certain trends, however, the team also needed to earnestly describe the phenomena these words were meant to capture. These reports caught the attention of people in the art community, but they went mostly unnoticed in the broader business world. That is, until K-Hole was invited to speak at a design conference in London, where they were challenged to think about how youth culture might look in the future. That’s when they came up with their most successful neologism: normcore.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/14d705d977f91874d649cd5935b74e1e/tumblr_inline_po1pbtxlo51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc50f1939504c37b705bd0d0b51528cd/tumblr_inline_po1ozoqGql1qfex1b_540.png)\n\nAlmost immediately after K-Hole released their fourth report in late 2013, the term normcore went viral. _[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/fashion/normcore-fashion-movement-or-massive-in-joke.html)_ deconstructed the idea half-tongue-in-cheek, questioning whether news media organizations were falling for an internet meme that had turned into a massive in-joke. Normcore, they said, was a fashion movement in which “scruffy young urbanites swear off the tired street-style clichés of the last decade — skinny jeans, wallet chains, flannel shirts — in favor of a less-ironic (but still pretty ironic) embrace of bland, suburban anti-fashion attire. (See Jeans, mom. Sneakers, white). \\[…\\] Even so, the fundamental question — is normcore real? — remains a matter of debate, even among the people who foisted the term upon the world.”\n\n[_New York Magazine’s_ The Cut](https://www.thecut.com/2014/02/normcore-fashion-trend.html)\n wrote about the new urban camouflage. [HuffPost Live](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/06/normcore_n_4912788.html)\n held a discussion on the trend. [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2014/4/16/5613542/9-questions-youre-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-normcore)\n wrote a normcore explainer for normies. The term snowballed into headlines at _[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/feb/27/normcore-the-next-big-fashion-movement)\n_, _[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickhanlon/2014/03/16/normcore-disrupts-fashion-brand-identity)\n_, and _[Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/daily-news/2014/03/normcore-fashion)\n_, making it about more than fashion and extending it into the broader culture. Brands such as [The Gap](https://twitter.com/Gap/status/439091955645960192)\n and [Hanes](https://twitter.com/Hanes/status/454340597852012544)\n boasted of being OG normcore. The term almost won “Word of the Year for 2014” in the Oxford English Dictionary (it tied with bae, but lost to vape). Since its coining, [nearly 40,000 news stories](https://www.google.com/search?q=normcore&tbm=nws&cad=h)\n have been written about normcore. This was all before people outside of Brooklyn were even wearing the style as a fashion statement. It was trend reporting before a trend. \n\nThe weird thing about normcore is how much of its success hinged on linguistics, rather than aesthetics. K-Hole came up with the term to mean a kind of social adaptability – dressing like a dandy at Pitti Uomo is normcore, just as it would be to wear a mohawk at a punk show. Both allow the wearer to disappear into the crowd, recognizing that “normal” is totally contextual. “Normcore was about dropping the pretense and learning to throw themselves into, without detachment, whatever subcultures or activities they stumbled into, even if they were mainstream,” explained the _Times_. But as soon as the word was run through the cultural machine, it metastasized. Soon, it came to refer to a particular mallcore look – Jerry Seinfeld in his garment-dyed button-ups and stonewashed jeans; Steve Jobs in his clingy, black turtlenecks and gray New Balance runners. Normcore is a kind of studied unfashionableness for the fashionable. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/28108c388fea29f48f0d99fa4322f1d8/tumblr_inline_po2nk28SJl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nPart of normcore’s charm is how it doesn’t mean anything, which means it can be used for almost everything. The first half is norm, from normal; the second half is -core, meaning hardcore or extreme. The term is irresistible, puzzling, and fun. It baits people into conversations, enticing them to ask “is this normcore” or “am I fashionable now?” Like Marcel Duchamp’s urinal, it makes people reconsider what counts as stylish. It’s popularity also comes out of a poverty of language. [In a _British Vogue_ video exploring how fashion PR works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtaaPlgt-QI)\n, one of K-Hole’s founding members told Alexa Chueng_:_ \n\n> People needed more vocabulary for fashion. There weren’t many words to describe how people were dressing \\[“Fabulous?,” Chueng jokes\\]. Besides fabulous. The idea of a hipster had been totally exhausted, but in my opinion, one of the reasons why the word hipster went on for so long is because there were no new words to talk about how to dress in a certain way, to have personal style, or to think of yourself as cool. I think we came into a vacuum. \n\nDressing normcore started off as a joke until it wasn’t one. [In a Highsnobiety podcast](https://www.highsnobiety.com/podcasts/)\n on the etymology of fuccboi, Mary H.K. Choi talks about how fashion at the moment is defined by subversive humor, in-group winking, and memes. In 2014, shortly after K-Hole’s report was released, people were starting to get into the style as a joke, but then the aesthetic became a legitimate category. Louis Vuitton’s Kim Jones took the classic Patagonia Retro-X fleece jacket and made it lux. Birkenstocks aren’t just a fashion statement, they’ve got designer collaborations.\n\n> I think there’s something funny about what \\[Vetements\\] is able to pull off. That doesn’t mean I’m going to buy a DHL t-shirt, but I love the attitude with which it’s pulled off. I love that it feels like high-fashion trolling, which I think is always hysterical. It captures Franco Moschino’s attitude towards fashion. It shows how the people who follow these trends do it so slavishly. When there’s a spectacle like this and people buy into it, if you’re aware of what you’re doing when you buy into it, I think it becomes funny. There’s nothing more hysterical than if you bought one of those \\[Vetements\\] hoodies, put it on ice, and wore it right when it was coming out of style. \n\nIn the way the word spread like a brush fire across certain corners of the internet, normcore may be the first purely internet-created fashion trend. It’s also an example of sound branding – a strange intersection of linguistics and aesthetics, where the catchiness of a word turned the simple act of “being” into a fashionable act. Normcore is the precursor to every frump-chic style that has emerged since late 2013: dad style, gorpcore, Patagonia fleece, New Balances, track pants, fanny packs, bloated sneakers, and all things staid. For better or worse, it’s also made fashion more relatable. Whereas men’s fashion once pulled from the aspirational lifestyles of blue-blooded WASPs, Italian industrialists, and virtuous blue-collar workers, today’s icons are everyday people. One wonders if things could have turned out differently if the word wasn’t so irresistible. \n\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n© Die, Workwear\n\n[Previous Slide](#)\n[Next Slide](#)\n\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\n\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\n\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\n\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"How Sound Branding Changed Fashion — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"How Sound Branding Changed Fashion — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"If you were just getting into menswear ten years ago, you likely updated your wardrobe in one of two directions.

Historically known as a white-shoe investment bank, Goldman Sachs will be joining the Silicon Valley crowd by allowing its 36,000 employees to shed their coat-and-tie uniform and put on more casual attire. This shift would have been inconceivable thirty years ago when bankers relied on sober suits to earn their clients’ confidence. But as Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote in the memo, workplaces today are more casual and he wants to accommodate a younger workforce. [One Goldman Sachs employee told _GQ_ yesterday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-05/goldman-sachs-allows-bankers-to-trade-bespoke-suits-for-khakis)\n the firm’s dress code has actually been loosening for years. Still, the person noted, “all the men are _psyched_.\" \n\nSo if bankers no longer wear banker stripes, what should they wear? The email didn’t specify. The management only said they want employees to dress in a manner that accords with the company’s and clients’ expectations (whatever that means). \"We trust you will consistently exercise good judgment in this regard,” they wrote ominously. “All of us know what is and is not appropriate for the workplace.\" \n\nThis is the problem with modern dress codes. Hard-written rules have been replaced by softly coded norms, which leaves many confused on how they’re supposed to dress. _Are grey flannel trousers too dressy? Are sneakers too sloppy? What should I wear for the meeting or office party?_ When the accounting firm Crowe Horwath gave up on the coat-and-tie a few years ago, they had to film a video explaining what was not acceptable. \n\nThis “not too formal, but still professional” dress code has given men one uniform: flat-front chinos, probably tan, worn with a button-up shirt, probably gingham. The look doesn’t live up to the potential of casualwear, but it’s also not as sharp as a coat-and-tie. It’s not ugly; it’s just vanilla bland. You could break it, of course, but at the risk of paying a social cost. A few years ago, Anna North wrote a [_New York Times_ op-ed](https://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/the-new-business-casual-is-still-uptight/?_r=0)\n about how the new, cool, office environment can be \"just as oppressive as the old, buttoned-up one.” Dressing now follows subtle, in-group views – those who understand them know how to navigate the corporate world; those who don’t pay the price.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31a8785c88eafc67837755ffaccbc6d7/tumblr_inline_pnyla4yV031qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n> The theme is familiar to anyone who’s tried to join a country club or high-school clique. It’s not supposed to make sense. The Culture can’t really be written about; it has to be experienced. You are expected to conform to the rules of The Culture before you are allowed to demonstrate your actual worth. What wearing a suit really indicates is — I am not making this up — _non-conformity_, one of the gravest of sins. For extra excitement, the rules are unwritten and ever-changing, and you will never be told how you screwed up.\n> \n> Silicon Valley start-ups may not care about professionalism in the pants-that-aren’t-jeans sense — they may actively discourage it — but, in Mr. Bueno’s formulation, they have a set of codes that may be even more restrictive because only those already in the clique really understand them. He writes: “The first step toward dissolving these petty Cultures is writing down their unwritten rules for all to see. The word ‘privilege’ literally means ‘private law.’ It’s the secrecy, deniable and immune to analysis, that makes the balance of power so lopsided in favor of insiders.”\n\nIn my years of writing about men’s style, I’ve found this problem that doesn’t just remain in the office, it extends into people’s personal lives. Men struggle with knowing how to dress well and comfortably, in a way that looks good without standing out. Suits and sport coats, even in their most casual patch-pocket form, can be too dressy. Classic casualwear, such as what you’ll find at [Brooks Brothers](https://rstyle.me/+6JgU3jUg7HhAQ2YFeRD8WQ)\n, is little more than bizcaz attire. And yet, anything more interesting – from the Brutalism of Rick Owens to on-trend streetwear – can make many feel uncomfortably out of place. Dressing well, but casually, has never been harder, partly because it requires not only thinking about how others see you through your clothing, but how you see yourself. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c648d8187cbedaaa5330c20a5ba26cb/tumblr_inline_pnpaqvCmHU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b7270b08896f36905d84c09a72ba01a/tumblr_inline_pnpaqzp5VI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**A MORE RELATABLE STYLE**\n\nCasualwear today is as varied as people’s identities, which is why it’s so hard to recommend a generic uniform. But to the degree that a look can be stretched across different lifestyles, it would be hard to find something better than Andrew Chen’s. Andrew is a co-owner of two of my favorite businesses – [3sixteen](https://www.3sixteen.com/)\n and [Self Edge,](https://bit.ly/2ESkypZ)\n both purveyors of high-end denim and workwear. While his style wouldn’t work for client-facing offices, it suits most other environments. \n\nOne of the things I love about Andrew’s style is its relatability. This isn’t the look of blue-blooded WASPs and Italian industrialists (which, while good, are more aspirational than relatable). Instead, Andrew’s lifestyle reflects many of those I know. He’s an Asian American who grew up with an avid interest in music and street culture; he’s a family man who loves his kids and wife; and he’s a person who, upon graduating from college, went to work in the corporate world before turning a passion project into a full-time job (something I often hear from people in my generation). \n\nAt its core, Andrew’s wardrobe relies on heavier denim, flannels, and t-shirts. “I don’t think my wardrobe has changed much over the years,” says Andrew. “It’s strange when someone asks to do a profile on how you dress because I never really thought about it before. But the other day I looked at my closet and it was full of plaid flannel shirts. I still wear the same things I wore fifteen years ago – hoodies, sweats, flannels, t-shirts, and jeans. Things just fit better.” \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ebc69b26f732272e22fe732bc0f3fc3/tumblr_inline_pnpaqsM7jh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nAndrew says his kids are pretty well-behaved, but dads everywhere will appreciate the kind of hard-wearing fabrics that make up this look. The clothes are comfortable, easy to move in, and have that better-with-wear quality many love (good for new dads who spend a lot of time low to the ground). Andrew favors study cotton hoodies over loose, woolen knits, the second of which just turns into handholds for climbing kids. The materials are easy to care for, machine washable, and suit a busy lifestyle. “Except for outerwear, my clothes are things that can be thrown into the wash,” says Andrew. “The boots you see here, I don’t think I’ve wiped them down even once. The only time they’ve gotten any care was when they went in for a resoling. I care for my sneakers a lot more because sneakers don’t look as good when they’re thrashed, unless they’re white Chucks, but otherwise I don’t like babying my stuff.”\n\nMost of all, the styles are rooted in the sort of workwear classics that have become part of a modern American uniform – something you’re just as likely to see in San Francisco as Des Moines. [As my friend Pete at Put This On wrote](https://putthison.com/fathering-your-whole-style-how-might-becoming-a/)\n: “Finding and growing your personal style is half the enjoyment of clothing, but many dads will find themselves in settings that are in many ways analogous to the office – standing out _too_ much is not necessarily the goal. Ideal dad style has to be comfortable and not too fussy, but it’s not an excuse for track pants and Adidas slides all the time. It should be something you can roll around in, sling a (diaper) bag over your shoulder, whip up a meal, and still reasonably wear to the movies or dinner.” \n\nIt’s also versatile, another sensible dad value. In the photos here, you can see how Andrew combines plaid flannels with t-shirts and jeans for a solid look, but he also layers a black [Homecore](http://homecore.com)\n knit with a newly acquired [Schott B-3](https://therake.com/schott-brown-b3-leather-jacket.html)\n (”easily the best purchase I’ve made in a while,” Andrew says of his shearling bomber). A few photos above, you can see him spending a day with his two sons, Logan and Hunter, while wearing jeans and an all-black, raw denim trucker jacket. On his Instagram, you can see other family-friendly combinations involving [waxed cotton jackets](https://www.instagram.com/p/Br0TBvsHTMZ/)\n, [zip-up hoodies](https://www.instagram.com/p/BueWKdjnCZv/)\n, and [printed pineapple shirts](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkJYo_VHZuZ/)\n. Naturally, it helps to be handsome, have a good personality, and always be smiling – something I was [disappointed to learn last year](https://twitter.com/dieworkwear/status/1003036722303602688)\n – but these are the sort of basics most men can work into their wardrobe in some manner or another. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d47f250773ebd3c1eb3e3451dda2fc91/tumblr_inline_pnparerJqU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**BUILDING ON THE BASICS**\n\nFor those so inspired, these basics also lend themselves to more directional looks. In the photo above, you can see Andrew teaming [3sixteen’s white tee](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/tees/products/heavyweight-pocket-t-shirt-long-white-2-pack)\n with the company’s new slimmed-down cargo pants, [Viberg work boots](https://viberg.com/)\n, and a [Chamula Cowichan-inspired sweater](https://chamulaoriginal.com/knitwear?category=Cardigans)\n (“internally, we call it the librarian sweater,” he says of the knit). In the photo below, he wears an [Iron Heart N-1 deck jacket](https://www.ironheart.co.uk/military-and-other-jackets/)\n with a [Stevenson Overall denim Western shirt](https://www.selfedge.com/stevenson-overall-co?product_id=1744&tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=10737-b1d329)\n, [3sixteen’s CH-44x selvedge chinos](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/bottoms/products/ch-44x-khaki-selvedge-chino)\n, and [Viberg x 3sixteen waxed-flesh Chelseas](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/footwear/products/chelsea-boot-waxed-flesh)\n. “I’ve been really into laceless shoes. Viberg’s lasts are just so flattering on foot, and I find Brett Viberg is obsessive about construction,” Andrew says. “With a [roper boot](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/footwear/products/copy-of-roper-boot-aged-bark-roughout)\n, it’s like wearing a big ol’ slip-on.” Further down is an image of him in one of his [company’s hunting jackets](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/outerwear/products/hunting-jacket-tan-canvas)\n, [a crosscut flannel](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/shirts/products/crosscut-flannel-15-year-indigo-check)\n, some vintage reverse sateen OG-107 fatigues, and (out of frame) black [Visvim](https://rstyle.me/+SUqGpUMSEZ69DiYRml7OyQ)\n Skagway lows.\n\n“I’ve been wearing those fatigues a lot,” Andrew says of his forays into more experimental looks. “For a while, I was afraid of baggier pants, but when I got those fatigues, I sized up one and my friend said ‘size up one more!’ So they’re two sizes bigger than what I normally wear. When the fabric is really soft, I think it hangs and stacks in a way that doesn’t look sloppy. I’ve also been having a lot of fun with sneakers. I’ll always get excited over a pair of [New Balance 990s](https://rstyle.me/+LQFcyyWksb2QEMtNxS8yBQ)\n, but in the last year, I’ve picked up the [CDG Mowabbs](https://rstyle.me/+1A0mR8-XGGJzgzbJzL0myA)\n and [Nike React 87s](https://stockx.com/nike-react-element-87-sail-light-bone)\n. When I first saw the React 87s, I knew I had to have them. They’re a crazy looking shoe. I wear them with [Monitaly](https://bit.ly/2H2ljit)\n pants, [Engineered Garments](https://bit.ly/2rKQDaT)\n utility pants, and of course [our jeans](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/bottoms)\n.” \n\nFor guys who are just learning to dress intentionally, there’s often the urge to make an outfit “pop” using kooky accessories. Over time, most people find that less is more – it’s better to focus on fit and create a message with your clothes, rather than overdo the details. But eventually, you also learn to layer accessories in a way that’s more thoughtful. Andrew here wears a white [six-paneled cap](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/accessories/products/baseball-cap-natural-hbt-splatter)\n inspired by a painter drop-cloth tote he made through his side project, [Broken Feather](https://brokenfeather.bigcartel.com/)\n; a thick woolen watch cap from [Buzz Rickson](https://bit.ly/2tRYwx1)\n; [an indigo bandana](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/accessories/products/bandana-dark-indigo)\n; and eyewear frames from [Han Kjøbenhavn](https://hankjobenhavn.com/)\n and [Globe Specs](https://bit.ly/2VE99zr)\n (“their Tokyo store is the best eyewear store in the world,” he says of Globe Specs). My favorites include the jewelry: [some silver rings](https://bit.ly/2TwMmbz)\n [from Native American silversmiths](https://bit.ly/2ECVRwi)\n, a Good Art’s 10A bracelet, and two [Good Art chain necklaces](https://bit.ly/2IUAeNm)\n, one with a 3sixteen 15th-anniversary pendant. “Jewelry has been a lot of fun. I feel like it allows you to inject a little personality into an outfit.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/870098cec39230f0b7216792c0b48a65/tumblr_inline_pnparvjJLf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**SUGGESTIONS FOR DEVELOPING A CASUAL WARDROBE**\n\nAlmost everyone has jeans and flannels in their closet. When I pressed Andrew for suggestions on how guys can wear them in better ways, we both struggled to come up with specifics. [Like in my interview with Dick and Ben at The Armoury](https://dieworkwear.com/post/181061526549/tailoring-for-younger-guys)\n, the phrases “it depends” and “don’t get too hung up on things” came up a lot. Your best bet is to shop around, keep an open miind about combinations, and develop your eye. Some slightly more specific suggestions from Andrew: \n\n**On Materials:**  “When I shop for a flannel, I pay attention to the material. Flat Head flannels are unique in that their yarns are so coarse and thick, the weave looks three-dimensional. I also love Iron Heart’s flannels because of their sheer weight. Living in a city with colder winters, they’re comfortable and useful. Similarly, when we made our t-shirts, I made sure we went with a heavier 225 gsm fabric. The tees have a triple-needle, coverstitched, never-sag collar that stays tight around the neck over many wears. A good fabric can make all the difference in how a garment looks.” \\[Derek’s note: 3sixteen’s heavyweight tees won [_The Wall Street Journal’s_ 50+ tee shootout in 2017](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-great-t-shirt-test-we-tried-on-50from-6-to-415-1495554711)\\\n). \\\n\\\n**On Body Type:** “There are so many jeans on the market, finding the right pair will depend on your body type. Our company makes multiple fits, and each person will find their ideal fit in a different model. Start with thinking about what you like or don’t like about your current jeans – are they too full, too tapered, too low? This will help a sales associate find you a better pair.” \\\n\\\n**On Focusing:** “Pick one part of your wardrobe and go learn about it. Check out high-end shops, low-end shops, and vintage shops. Once you’ve tried enough things, you’ll know what you like. For me, when I pick up a mass-produced flannel and compare it to something of higher-quality, the difference is obvious. I’m not going to spend $50 on a cheaper flannel because I know I’ll never wear it. I’d rather have a more expensive flannel that makes me feel good every morning.”\\\n\\\n**On Sales Associates:** “Go to a place that sells a really expensive version of the item you’re interested in. Then ask them why something cost what it does. Be open to learning about it, but also be polite. If it’s a good store, they can help you learn.”\\\n\\\n**On Having Fun:** “Don’t over think it. When you come out of the dressing room, does it look good? Does it make you feel excited? Clothes should be fun and move you. It just comes down to a feeling. They should make you feel stoked. In the end, if you bought the right size, you’re way ahead of the game anyway.” \\\n\\\n_For more on Andrew, [check out his interview at Blamo!](https://soundcloud.com/blamoshow/s02e02-andrew-chen-3sixteen)\\\n_\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d7379cb7e241dd7aaec7528dff71099/tumblr_inline_pnpa4tJ7j81qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a122e2abeafa2f19efa6f545b1998996/tumblr_inline_pnparmDuWB1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/204ed81093085c2fcfb2dc255e6b257b/tumblr_inline_pnpatmuL4E1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5be33e553bc85f236c9916ec2129fb84/tumblr_inline_pnpathLi871qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dff99baf9e363e6e703f6c3b7ffc335b/tumblr_inline_pnpa17KdWg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a90eabf5346e64ef15817465c7032d0/tumblr_inline_pnpa6hcLoB1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/edcb7290e438e7a06abacc5a47de9c30/tumblr_inline_pnpa4sLFCg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/74e7766e17e97908f05b150d863a7c61/tumblr_inline_pnpa1gIwn41qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/58019cf0b727ce332a230894117c14a2/tumblr_inline_pnpa2eTZVA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73740b98e532c425886c6c70db0e28ba/tumblr_inline_pnpa10q9K71qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb52cd91fbffdefc3d45790c31ea509d/tumblr_inline_pnpa1aMN921qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/596c7690e5f28f503a56571ead150ca9/tumblr_inline_pnp9vsXQ5s1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba77aba2b384d444a189ef34803714ee/tumblr_inline_pnpa1bOFaf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/65bfa3d92b1865a4aa6a5a9ac19a74db/tumblr_inline_pnpa2jiEQs1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/97b3494f5ce8e7cfdd8689d4e2ea9506/tumblr_inline_pnpa0cSSeg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/718ca5c44d9b6fb5e37db9c271ffcf5f/tumblr_inline_pnpa49M3Up1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73ed5adc536e8ebea96fc86f2cb70148/tumblr_inline_pnpa4aSJbP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/828f11d7511d86df71bf3c4053367252/tumblr_inline_pnpa10tATr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/21217cd0fac3886d39d1e4b80c3b8f97/tumblr_inline_pnpa12OkKI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bed14382e44a5a7092af5949ed41c26a/tumblr_inline_pnp9zba7bo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c4dfcd979d7600af9bd1beec32cbbf51/tumblr_inline_pnp9vhgG0y1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cf39a482376b8d26a0e263e471905c67/tumblr_inline_pnp9vj2hdb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7c8cb05059ae077f719a35f305284998/tumblr_inline_pnp9vphxZQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/821ad4f41f9b0f337c030437c184f1b4/tumblr_inline_pnp9vx8nXk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ab95a74511e131e912fa582c6a82f99/tumblr_inline_pnp9vzpOAw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e1dbb2906e7917e87d08ae6c7245439/tumblr_inline_pnp9vw1VZt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/43962e811fe21b531a66d94c536b5376/tumblr_inline_pnp9vyi92S1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f4c0872a1348fc08ff653d103f914988/tumblr_inline_pnp9w1vMGP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ded0436d42df8a1c40320ef49a796c1e/tumblr_inline_pnp9vhWfvI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\\\n\\\n© Die, Workwear\\\n\\\n[Previous Slide](#)\\\n[Next Slide](#)\\\n\\\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\\\n\\\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\\\n\\\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\\\n\\\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\\\n\\\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","markdown":"\n\n[![](https://dieworkwear.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/banner4.png)](https://dieworkwear.com)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6814b46ee97b6896040b32f1da7f4704/tumblr_inline_pnpardWOrD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n[In a firm-wide email sent Tuesday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-05/goldman-sachs-allows-bankers-to-trade-bespoke-suits-for-khakis)\n, the top-brass at Goldman Sachs told employees they’re loosening the company’s fashion standard. Historically known as a white-shoe investment bank, Goldman Sachs will be joining the Silicon Valley crowd by allowing its 36,000 employees to shed their coat-and-tie uniform and put on more casual attire. This shift would have been inconceivable thirty years ago when bankers relied on sober suits to earn their clients’ confidence. But as Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote in the memo, workplaces today are more casual and he wants to accommodate a younger workforce. [One Goldman Sachs employee told _GQ_ yesterday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-05/goldman-sachs-allows-bankers-to-trade-bespoke-suits-for-khakis)\n the firm’s dress code has actually been loosening for years. Still, the person noted, “all the men are _psyched_.\" \n\nSo if bankers no longer wear banker stripes, what should they wear? The email didn’t specify. The management only said they want employees to dress in a manner that accords with the company’s and clients’ expectations (whatever that means). \"We trust you will consistently exercise good judgment in this regard,” they wrote ominously. “All of us know what is and is not appropriate for the workplace.\" \n\nThis is the problem with modern dress codes. Hard-written rules have been replaced by softly coded norms, which leaves many confused on how they’re supposed to dress. _Are grey flannel trousers too dressy? Are sneakers too sloppy? What should I wear for the meeting or office party?_ When the accounting firm Crowe Horwath gave up on the coat-and-tie a few years ago, they had to film a video explaining what was not acceptable. \n\nThis “not too formal, but still professional” dress code has given men one uniform: flat-front chinos, probably tan, worn with a button-up shirt, probably gingham. The look doesn’t live up to the potential of casualwear, but it’s also not as sharp as a coat-and-tie. It’s not ugly; it’s just vanilla bland. You could break it, of course, but at the risk of paying a social cost. A few years ago, Anna North wrote a [_New York Times_ op-ed](https://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/the-new-business-casual-is-still-uptight/?_r=0)\n about how the new, cool, office environment can be \"just as oppressive as the old, buttoned-up one.” Dressing now follows subtle, in-group views – those who understand them know how to navigate the corporate world; those who don’t pay the price.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31a8785c88eafc67837755ffaccbc6d7/tumblr_inline_pnyla4yV031qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n> The theme is familiar to anyone who’s tried to join a country club or high-school clique. It’s not supposed to make sense. The Culture can’t really be written about; it has to be experienced. You are expected to conform to the rules of The Culture before you are allowed to demonstrate your actual worth. What wearing a suit really indicates is — I am not making this up — _non-conformity_, one of the gravest of sins. For extra excitement, the rules are unwritten and ever-changing, and you will never be told how you screwed up.\n> \n> Silicon Valley start-ups may not care about professionalism in the pants-that-aren’t-jeans sense — they may actively discourage it — but, in Mr. Bueno’s formulation, they have a set of codes that may be even more restrictive because only those already in the clique really understand them. He writes: “The first step toward dissolving these petty Cultures is writing down their unwritten rules for all to see. The word ‘privilege’ literally means ‘private law.’ It’s the secrecy, deniable and immune to analysis, that makes the balance of power so lopsided in favor of insiders.”\n\nIn my years of writing about men’s style, I’ve found this problem that doesn’t just remain in the office, it extends into people’s personal lives. Men struggle with knowing how to dress well and comfortably, in a way that looks good without standing out. Suits and sport coats, even in their most casual patch-pocket form, can be too dressy. Classic casualwear, such as what you’ll find at [Brooks Brothers](https://rstyle.me/+6JgU3jUg7HhAQ2YFeRD8WQ)\n, is little more than bizcaz attire. And yet, anything more interesting – from the Brutalism of Rick Owens to on-trend streetwear – can make many feel uncomfortably out of place. Dressing well, but casually, has never been harder, partly because it requires not only thinking about how others see you through your clothing, but how you see yourself. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c648d8187cbedaaa5330c20a5ba26cb/tumblr_inline_pnpaqvCmHU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b7270b08896f36905d84c09a72ba01a/tumblr_inline_pnpaqzp5VI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**A MORE RELATABLE STYLE**\n\nCasualwear today is as varied as people’s identities, which is why it’s so hard to recommend a generic uniform. But to the degree that a look can be stretched across different lifestyles, it would be hard to find something better than Andrew Chen’s. Andrew is a co-owner of two of my favorite businesses – [3sixteen](https://www.3sixteen.com/)\n and [Self Edge,](https://bit.ly/2ESkypZ)\n both purveyors of high-end denim and workwear. While his style wouldn’t work for client-facing offices, it suits most other environments. \n\nOne of the things I love about Andrew’s style is its relatability. This isn’t the look of blue-blooded WASPs and Italian industrialists (which, while good, are more aspirational than relatable). Instead, Andrew’s lifestyle reflects many of those I know. He’s an Asian American who grew up with an avid interest in music and street culture; he’s a family man who loves his kids and wife; and he’s a person who, upon graduating from college, went to work in the corporate world before turning a passion project into a full-time job (something I often hear from people in my generation). \n\nAt its core, Andrew’s wardrobe relies on heavier denim, flannels, and t-shirts. “I don’t think my wardrobe has changed much over the years,” says Andrew. “It’s strange when someone asks to do a profile on how you dress because I never really thought about it before. But the other day I looked at my closet and it was full of plaid flannel shirts. I still wear the same things I wore fifteen years ago – hoodies, sweats, flannels, t-shirts, and jeans. Things just fit better.” \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ebc69b26f732272e22fe732bc0f3fc3/tumblr_inline_pnpaqsM7jh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nAndrew says his kids are pretty well-behaved, but dads everywhere will appreciate the kind of hard-wearing fabrics that make up this look. The clothes are comfortable, easy to move in, and have that better-with-wear quality many love (good for new dads who spend a lot of time low to the ground). Andrew favors study cotton hoodies over loose, woolen knits, the second of which just turns into handholds for climbing kids. The materials are easy to care for, machine washable, and suit a busy lifestyle. “Except for outerwear, my clothes are things that can be thrown into the wash,” says Andrew. “The boots you see here, I don’t think I’ve wiped them down even once. The only time they’ve gotten any care was when they went in for a resoling. I care for my sneakers a lot more because sneakers don’t look as good when they’re thrashed, unless they’re white Chucks, but otherwise I don’t like babying my stuff.”\n\nMost of all, the styles are rooted in the sort of workwear classics that have become part of a modern American uniform – something you’re just as likely to see in San Francisco as Des Moines. [As my friend Pete at Put This On wrote](https://putthison.com/fathering-your-whole-style-how-might-becoming-a/)\n: “Finding and growing your personal style is half the enjoyment of clothing, but many dads will find themselves in settings that are in many ways analogous to the office – standing out _too_ much is not necessarily the goal. Ideal dad style has to be comfortable and not too fussy, but it’s not an excuse for track pants and Adidas slides all the time. It should be something you can roll around in, sling a (diaper) bag over your shoulder, whip up a meal, and still reasonably wear to the movies or dinner.” \n\nIt’s also versatile, another sensible dad value. In the photos here, you can see how Andrew combines plaid flannels with t-shirts and jeans for a solid look, but he also layers a black [Homecore](http://homecore.com)\n knit with a newly acquired [Schott B-3](https://therake.com/schott-brown-b3-leather-jacket.html)\n (”easily the best purchase I’ve made in a while,” Andrew says of his shearling bomber). A few photos above, you can see him spending a day with his two sons, Logan and Hunter, while wearing jeans and an all-black, raw denim trucker jacket. On his Instagram, you can see other family-friendly combinations involving [waxed cotton jackets](https://www.instagram.com/p/Br0TBvsHTMZ/)\n, [zip-up hoodies](https://www.instagram.com/p/BueWKdjnCZv/)\n, and [printed pineapple shirts](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkJYo_VHZuZ/)\n. Naturally, it helps to be handsome, have a good personality, and always be smiling – something I was [disappointed to learn last year](https://twitter.com/dieworkwear/status/1003036722303602688)\n – but these are the sort of basics most men can work into their wardrobe in some manner or another. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d47f250773ebd3c1eb3e3451dda2fc91/tumblr_inline_pnparerJqU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**BUILDING ON THE BASICS**\n\nFor those so inspired, these basics also lend themselves to more directional looks. In the photo above, you can see Andrew teaming [3sixteen’s white tee](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/tees/products/heavyweight-pocket-t-shirt-long-white-2-pack)\n with the company’s new slimmed-down cargo pants, [Viberg work boots](https://viberg.com/)\n, and a [Chamula Cowichan-inspired sweater](https://chamulaoriginal.com/knitwear?category=Cardigans)\n (“internally, we call it the librarian sweater,” he says of the knit). In the photo below, he wears an [Iron Heart N-1 deck jacket](https://www.ironheart.co.uk/military-and-other-jackets/)\n with a [Stevenson Overall denim Western shirt](https://www.selfedge.com/stevenson-overall-co?product_id=1744&tap_s=128780-d5c5a8&tap_a=10737-b1d329)\n, [3sixteen’s CH-44x selvedge chinos](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/bottoms/products/ch-44x-khaki-selvedge-chino)\n, and [Viberg x 3sixteen waxed-flesh Chelseas](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/footwear/products/chelsea-boot-waxed-flesh)\n. “I’ve been really into laceless shoes. Viberg’s lasts are just so flattering on foot, and I find Brett Viberg is obsessive about construction,” Andrew says. “With a [roper boot](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/footwear/products/copy-of-roper-boot-aged-bark-roughout)\n, it’s like wearing a big ol’ slip-on.” Further down is an image of him in one of his [company’s hunting jackets](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/outerwear/products/hunting-jacket-tan-canvas)\n, [a crosscut flannel](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/shirts/products/crosscut-flannel-15-year-indigo-check)\n, some vintage reverse sateen OG-107 fatigues, and (out of frame) black [Visvim](https://rstyle.me/+SUqGpUMSEZ69DiYRml7OyQ)\n Skagway lows.\n\n“I’ve been wearing those fatigues a lot,” Andrew says of his forays into more experimental looks. “For a while, I was afraid of baggier pants, but when I got those fatigues, I sized up one and my friend said ‘size up one more!’ So they’re two sizes bigger than what I normally wear. When the fabric is really soft, I think it hangs and stacks in a way that doesn’t look sloppy. I’ve also been having a lot of fun with sneakers. I’ll always get excited over a pair of [New Balance 990s](https://rstyle.me/+LQFcyyWksb2QEMtNxS8yBQ)\n, but in the last year, I’ve picked up the [CDG Mowabbs](https://rstyle.me/+1A0mR8-XGGJzgzbJzL0myA)\n and [Nike React 87s](https://stockx.com/nike-react-element-87-sail-light-bone)\n. When I first saw the React 87s, I knew I had to have them. They’re a crazy looking shoe. I wear them with [Monitaly](https://bit.ly/2H2ljit)\n pants, [Engineered Garments](https://bit.ly/2rKQDaT)\n utility pants, and of course [our jeans](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/bottoms)\n.” \n\nFor guys who are just learning to dress intentionally, there’s often the urge to make an outfit “pop” using kooky accessories. Over time, most people find that less is more – it’s better to focus on fit and create a message with your clothes, rather than overdo the details. But eventually, you also learn to layer accessories in a way that’s more thoughtful. Andrew here wears a white [six-paneled cap](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/accessories/products/baseball-cap-natural-hbt-splatter)\n inspired by a painter drop-cloth tote he made through his side project, [Broken Feather](https://brokenfeather.bigcartel.com/)\n; a thick woolen watch cap from [Buzz Rickson](https://bit.ly/2tRYwx1)\n; [an indigo bandana](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/accessories/products/bandana-dark-indigo)\n; and eyewear frames from [Han Kjøbenhavn](https://hankjobenhavn.com/)\n and [Globe Specs](https://bit.ly/2VE99zr)\n (“their Tokyo store is the best eyewear store in the world,” he says of Globe Specs). My favorites include the jewelry: [some silver rings](https://bit.ly/2TwMmbz)\n [from Native American silversmiths](https://bit.ly/2ECVRwi)\n, a Good Art’s 10A bracelet, and two [Good Art chain necklaces](https://bit.ly/2IUAeNm)\n, one with a 3sixteen 15th-anniversary pendant. “Jewelry has been a lot of fun. I feel like it allows you to inject a little personality into an outfit.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/870098cec39230f0b7216792c0b48a65/tumblr_inline_pnparvjJLf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**SUGGESTIONS FOR DEVELOPING A CASUAL WARDROBE**\n\nAlmost everyone has jeans and flannels in their closet. When I pressed Andrew for suggestions on how guys can wear them in better ways, we both struggled to come up with specifics. [Like in my interview with Dick and Ben at The Armoury](https://dieworkwear.com/post/181061526549/tailoring-for-younger-guys)\n, the phrases “it depends” and “don’t get too hung up on things” came up a lot. Your best bet is to shop around, keep an open miind about combinations, and develop your eye. Some slightly more specific suggestions from Andrew: \n\n**On Materials:**  “When I shop for a flannel, I pay attention to the material. Flat Head flannels are unique in that their yarns are so coarse and thick, the weave looks three-dimensional. I also love Iron Heart’s flannels because of their sheer weight. Living in a city with colder winters, they’re comfortable and useful. Similarly, when we made our t-shirts, I made sure we went with a heavier 225 gsm fabric. The tees have a triple-needle, coverstitched, never-sag collar that stays tight around the neck over many wears. A good fabric can make all the difference in how a garment looks.” \\[Derek’s note: 3sixteen’s heavyweight tees won [_The Wall Street Journal’s_ 50+ tee shootout in 2017](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-great-t-shirt-test-we-tried-on-50from-6-to-415-1495554711)\\\n). \\\n\\\n**On Body Type:** “There are so many jeans on the market, finding the right pair will depend on your body type. Our company makes multiple fits, and each person will find their ideal fit in a different model. Start with thinking about what you like or don’t like about your current jeans – are they too full, too tapered, too low? This will help a sales associate find you a better pair.” \\\n\\\n**On Focusing:** “Pick one part of your wardrobe and go learn about it. Check out high-end shops, low-end shops, and vintage shops. Once you’ve tried enough things, you’ll know what you like. For me, when I pick up a mass-produced flannel and compare it to something of higher-quality, the difference is obvious. I’m not going to spend $50 on a cheaper flannel because I know I’ll never wear it. I’d rather have a more expensive flannel that makes me feel good every morning.”\\\n\\\n**On Sales Associates:** “Go to a place that sells a really expensive version of the item you’re interested in. Then ask them why something cost what it does. Be open to learning about it, but also be polite. If it’s a good store, they can help you learn.”\\\n\\\n**On Having Fun:** “Don’t over think it. When you come out of the dressing room, does it look good? Does it make you feel excited? Clothes should be fun and move you. It just comes down to a feeling. They should make you feel stoked. In the end, if you bought the right size, you’re way ahead of the game anyway.” \\\n\\\n_For more on Andrew, [check out his interview at Blamo!](https://soundcloud.com/blamoshow/s02e02-andrew-chen-3sixteen)\\\n_\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d7379cb7e241dd7aaec7528dff71099/tumblr_inline_pnpa4tJ7j81qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a122e2abeafa2f19efa6f545b1998996/tumblr_inline_pnparmDuWB1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/204ed81093085c2fcfb2dc255e6b257b/tumblr_inline_pnpatmuL4E1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5be33e553bc85f236c9916ec2129fb84/tumblr_inline_pnpathLi871qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dff99baf9e363e6e703f6c3b7ffc335b/tumblr_inline_pnpa17KdWg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a90eabf5346e64ef15817465c7032d0/tumblr_inline_pnpa6hcLoB1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/edcb7290e438e7a06abacc5a47de9c30/tumblr_inline_pnpa4sLFCg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/74e7766e17e97908f05b150d863a7c61/tumblr_inline_pnpa1gIwn41qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/58019cf0b727ce332a230894117c14a2/tumblr_inline_pnpa2eTZVA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73740b98e532c425886c6c70db0e28ba/tumblr_inline_pnpa10q9K71qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb52cd91fbffdefc3d45790c31ea509d/tumblr_inline_pnpa1aMN921qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/596c7690e5f28f503a56571ead150ca9/tumblr_inline_pnp9vsXQ5s1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba77aba2b384d444a189ef34803714ee/tumblr_inline_pnpa1bOFaf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/65bfa3d92b1865a4aa6a5a9ac19a74db/tumblr_inline_pnpa2jiEQs1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/97b3494f5ce8e7cfdd8689d4e2ea9506/tumblr_inline_pnpa0cSSeg1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/718ca5c44d9b6fb5e37db9c271ffcf5f/tumblr_inline_pnpa49M3Up1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/73ed5adc536e8ebea96fc86f2cb70148/tumblr_inline_pnpa4aSJbP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/828f11d7511d86df71bf3c4053367252/tumblr_inline_pnpa10tATr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/21217cd0fac3886d39d1e4b80c3b8f97/tumblr_inline_pnpa12OkKI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/bed14382e44a5a7092af5949ed41c26a/tumblr_inline_pnp9zba7bo1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c4dfcd979d7600af9bd1beec32cbbf51/tumblr_inline_pnp9vhgG0y1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cf39a482376b8d26a0e263e471905c67/tumblr_inline_pnp9vj2hdb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7c8cb05059ae077f719a35f305284998/tumblr_inline_pnp9vphxZQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/821ad4f41f9b0f337c030437c184f1b4/tumblr_inline_pnp9vx8nXk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ab95a74511e131e912fa582c6a82f99/tumblr_inline_pnp9vzpOAw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e1dbb2906e7917e87d08ae6c7245439/tumblr_inline_pnp9vw1VZt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/43962e811fe21b531a66d94c536b5376/tumblr_inline_pnp9vyi92S1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f4c0872a1348fc08ff653d103f914988/tumblr_inline_pnp9w1vMGP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ded0436d42df8a1c40320ef49a796c1e/tumblr_inline_pnp9vhWfvI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\\\n\\\n[Home](https://dieworkwear.com)\\\n\\\n© Die, Workwear\\\n\\\n[Previous Slide](#)\\\n[Next Slide](#)\\\n\\\n[Share](JavaScript:void(0);)\\\n\\\nFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedin SharePinterest ShareEmail Share\\\n\\\n[TwitterTwitter](http://instagram.com/)\\\n\\\n[Hide Tweet (admin)](JavaScript:void(0);)\\\n\\\nAdd this ID to the plugin's **Hide Specific Tweets** setting:","metadata":{"title":"A Relatable Casual Uniform — Die, Workwear!","robots":"index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1","ogTitle":"A Relatable Casual Uniform — Die, Workwear!","ogDescription":"In a firm-wide email sent Tuesday, the top-brass at Goldman Sachs told employees they’re loosening the company’s fashion standard.

That’s where we fell in love with things such as sporting tweeds, chambray work shirts, and the chalky hand of ancient madder. Ralph Lauren didn’t invent these things, of course, but they presented them in a way that felt sexy. [Brooks Brothers](https://rstyle.me/ad/ig5zqvnjge)\n has been many things, but it has never been sexy. \n\nIn some ways, [Drake’s](https://www.drakes.com/usa/)\n is doing that for a younger generation, albeit at a much smaller scale. As the brand has expanded beyond just accessories, taking on tailoring and sportswear, it’s been able to present a fuller vision of how classic style can be worn today. These lookbooks have become incredibly popular in recent years, often getting posted on sites such as [Reddit’s Male Fashion Advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/)\n within minutes of their release. And much like how Ralph Lauren helped translate classic style for me, I think Drake’s is putting a new spin on the language. Instead of showing pinstripe suits in luxuriously paneled offices, with decor reminiscent of an expensive lawyer’s sanctum, they feature softer takes on classic menswear in more relatable environs. [Tweeds and duffle coats are shown being worn at university campuses](https://dieworkwear.com/post/178088997364/drakes-goes-collegiate)\n, [seersucker suits in Southern diners](https://dieworkwear.com/post/171209828819/drakes-takes-on-prep-for-spring)\n, and [brushed Shetlands on moss-covered, rocky shores](https://dieworkwear.com/post/165125558564/drakes-drops-new-fall-lookbook)\n. \n\nThis season, the team went to Lanzarote, one of the seven main Canary Islands located just off the coast of Morocco. It’s a short four-hour plane ride from London, making it a popular fly-and-flop destination for vacationing Brits (many retreat there for some much-needed winter warmth). But for Drake’s, the subtropical archipelago was also an excellent solution to a real problem. How do you shoot a spring/ summer lookbook in the middle of January, when it’s snowing in London? To show their collection in a warmer clime, they headed to the one place known as the “Island of Eternal Spring.” \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f25d606c789035982e9a8ce12310e7a0/tumblr_inline_pnkpg993ko1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nSome designers wipe the slate clean every season and start anew, but when I first interviewed [Drake’s Creative Director](https://www.styleforum.net/threads/q-a-with-michael-hill-of-drakes-conducted-by-derek-guy-of-styleforum-part-1-of-2.279785/)\n [Michael Hill seven years ago](https://www.styleforum.net/threads/q-a-with-michael-hill-of-drakes-part-2-of-2.281565/)\n, he described his work as a kind of evolutionary process. “If you look at our collections from season to season, our designs never move dramatically, but they do progress nicely and slowly,” he said. “When you go through the design process, you very naturally come up with fresh takes, either on things you found in the archive or things you’ve been developing with mills.” That means playing with a color scheme on an old David Evans pattern or coming up with a twist on last season’s yarns. \n\nThe company has stayed close to that design philosophy as they’ve grown into a fuller menswear label. This season still has soft-shouldered sport coats made in Italy – the mainline’s versions are all half-canvassed, the more affordable Easyday is totally deconstructed with just some light fusing. They also still do slim-straight legged, flat front chinos and trousers; shirts made in their own factory; and an admirable collection of knitwear. Everything just comes in new fabrics. \n\nI particularly like their tailoring this season, which goes beyond your usual linens and tropical wools (although, they have a [handsome, slubby linen sport coat too](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/natural-linen-jacket)\n). There’s a tonal [olive cotton seersucker suit](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/olive-cotton-seersucker-suit)\n, which is a fresher take on the milk-and-sugar classic, and a [navy glen check with some color variation in the yarns](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/blue-linen-glen-check-suit)\n. Patterned linens can sometimes be hard to wear because the lines can look so sharp, but this one is exceptional (it was also woven by Loro Piana). Being such casual fabrics, you could break these suits up into separates and wear the jackets alone with tan or gray trousers.  \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/81b3840b8c2de669abd83decc3a496f9/tumblr_inline_pnkpgiRMLh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/516d3be84b7720868655b88135a46540/tumblr_inline_pnnysaoFeC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThere are also some springtime versions of cold-weather favorites. [This wool-silk-linen sport coat](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/brown-wool-linen-gun-check-jacket)\n has a pattern that’s reminiscent of a gun club tweed, but it’s made from a material that’s light and breathable enough for summer (Michael notes the added silk-and-linen mixture gives the fabric a uniquely dry hand). [The garment washed, beige needlecord suit](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/beige-washed-cotton-needlecord-suit)\n, meanwhile, looks promising for those cold and damp spring days. When [I talked to Sid Mashburn a few months ago](https://dieworkwear.com/post/180843604584/are-fashion-seasons-outdated)\n, he said he wears finer ribs well into summer. “Even if it’s still cold in April, I won’t want to wear those chunky, wide waled cords, I feel like I’m mentally done with them. But a baby waled, five-pocket cord? I wear those throughout the summer. I think I picked that up from Californians who used to wear those baby-waled OP shorts – you think it’s a fall fabric, but they made it work for California’s warm climate.”\n\nAs usual, there’s always something exciting in Drake’s accessories section. This season, they have [crinkly viscose-blend scarves](https://www.drakes.com/usa/latest/rust-crinkle-stripe-scarf)\n that can add a touch of texture to an outfit, [expressive rhombus motif ties](https://www.drakes.com/usa/latest/navy-rhombus-motif-silk-tie)\n that look like they came straight out of an issue of _Apparel Arts_, and [single stick umbrellas](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/crimson-brown-and-gold-broad-striped-large-umbrella)\n inspired by Drake’s rep stripe ties. Among their casual outerwear, you’ll find Drake’s version of a [walking jacket](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/yellow-cotton-walking-jacket)\n – a classic British design made for [walking in the fells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_in_the_United_Kingdom)\n – and an [equestrian-inspired stable coat](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/olive-cotton-canvas-stable-jacket)\n. The stable coat looks a bit flat in product photos, but it comes into its own in the image above. The best thing about that jacket? The inside has a long, ten-inch strap that secures itself to a larger interior pocket. “The detachable strap forms a loop, from which you can hang a sweater or a scarf,” Michael explains. “It’s good for those days when you might need to carry a scarf on days that transition from warm afternoons to cold nights, but you don’t want to have to carry it around all day.” \n\n**HOW TO DRESS FOR SPRING**\n\nLookbooks are rarely meant to be taken literally. More often than not, they’re intended to convey a designer’s inspiration or vision, helping to set the mood for a season, rather than trying to give actual outfit ideas. Drake’s, however, is unique in that their presentations ride the line between inspiration and instruction. To be sure, the looks are still somewhat aggressively styled. This season, for example, they tied colorful sweatshirts around their models’ waists and shoulders to give the outfits some verve. But if you read between the lines, you’ll find some practical suggestions for how to dress this spring. I went over five areas with Michael.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/872b300a472260f6a28406721b3f3782/tumblr_inline_pnkp9oyfaE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**Incorporating Color**\n\nA good trick for spring is to brighten all of your usual colors. Navy turns to French blue, dark brown becomes dusty tan. But how do you incorporate more cheerful colors without turning into a Crayola box? Michael suggests using one bright color as an accent piece. “In our lookbook, we have one of the models wearing a bright, Kelly green tie with a washed out tan suit. I think the tie works in that case because it helps visually anchor everything, but it’s not something I would pair with a bright blue suit,” he says. “It’s like the high-low thing. If you’re wearing a bright color, tone it down everywhere else. Say if you’re interested in wearing a pink sweatshirt. Ask yourself what goes well with pink. Well, green. So try layering with a green piece of outerwear. It’s about balance.” \n\nThey’re not necessarily bright colors, but I like the [terrycloth hiking shirts](https://www.drakes.com/usa/catalogsearch/result/?q=TERRY)\n this season, which come in apple green and jam red (Michael tells me they were inspired by an old climbing shirt he has in his wardrobe). “Those would work with both casual tailoring or with jeans,” Michael notes. “Another good choice is a strongly striped shirt. Something in a [mid-blue](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/blue-and-white-awning-stripe-linen-spread-collar-shirt)\n or [grapefruit pink](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/orange-bengal-stripe-cotton-linen-point-collar-shirt)\n can be a way to incorporate more color into a wardrobe without making you feel like you’re stepping out of your comfort zone.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f9db08a687750dc81ed353c7c5f9740/tumblr_inline_pnkpdkycsk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0766c7749760b18a58967f1621f62d89/tumblr_inline_pnkpb53GpE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**The Field Shirt**\n\nSpring is full of opportunities to dress down tailoring. [These wheat-colored field shirts](https://www.drakes.com/usa/latest/tobacco-cotton-twill-two-pocket-work-shirt)\n remind me of the best days of Banana Republic, back when they were still a safari-themed outfitter and not just a generic mall brand. The shirts are casual enough for jeans and workwear, but they can also be used with suits and sport coats. “For our lookbook, we paired them with [a navy suit](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/navy-merino-wool-fresco-suit)\n and [olive seersucker](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/olive-cotton-seersucker-suit)\n,” says Michael. [This olive linen dress shirt](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/khaki-linen-spread-collar-shirt)\n could be used much in the same way (maybe not with an olive suit, but with similarly casual tailoring). \n\n**The Underrated Cotton Suit**\n\nLike most men, my spring/ summer tailoring mostly relies on tropical wools and linens – sometimes the rare bit of wool-silk-linen mix, if I can find something. Drake’s has some wonderfully unique options this season, including garment dyed and washed pieces that feel a bit more relaxed than what you can get through bespoke (since garment washing is only possible when you’re making things in large quantities). My two favorites this season are the [olive tonal seersucker](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/olive-cotton-seersucker-suit)\n and [wool-silk-linen sport coat](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/brown-wool-linen-gun-check-jacket)\n, but Michael says he’s [most excited about cotton](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/tan-cotton-twill-suit)\n. \n\n“I love cotton suits for all the same reasons some people hate them,” he says. “They’re stiff, they crumple, the color fades. They don’t look perfect, but I think that’s a good thing. I can picture my cotton suit sitting on the end of my rail at home now. The way the sleeves curl, it looks like my arms are in them, and the sleeves will probably stay like that even after the jacket has been cleaned. If you get one in a heavy drill cotton, the fabric almost moulds to your body. That’s the wonderful thing about cotton suits. They’re casual and age with you, much like a good pair of jeans.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5cdbe8e582aae1948c0ed1d4e41cced4/tumblr_inline_pnkpbjoLtr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**Summer Whites  \n**\n\nWhite is often considered a neutral base when it’s worn through shirts and sneakers, but put the color on legs and guys get uneasy. “We don’t think guys should be scared of white pants,” says Michael. “Particularly with white jeans or five-pocket cords, they can be a jumping off place for a lot of things. The advantage of white over classic blue jeans is that they’re easier to dress up. In fact, if you just substitute indigo jeans with white, suddenly an outfit can look a bit smarter. And they work in almost any situation where you’d wear blue jeans – they go with olive, navy, and stone colored jackets.”\n\nPerhaps the best thing about white jeans is that they’re an easy way to dress down a sport coat. Guys often try to dress down tailoring with denim – sometimes successfully, sometimes less so (I think the combo only works with certain cuts and materials). In the fall and winter months, this is easiest with tweeds and blue denim, but for summer, white jeans can be a more natural choice for [pure linen](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/brown-linen-glen-check-jacket)\n and [wool-silk-linen mixes](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/brown-wool-linen-gun-check-jacket)\n. “They work with desert boots, penny loafers, and classic sneakers,” says Michael. “It’s one of those things where, if a guy just wears a pair for a few days, I think you get over that mental hurdle.” \n\n**The Useful Suede Chukka**\n\nNo shoe will do everything, but Drake’s makes a strong case for suede chukkas. In their lookbook, you can see how they style them with casual suits, blue blazers, and game jackets ([I have a similar pair from Alden](https://bit.ly/2TnD4yh)\n, which I often wear with sport coats and tailored trousers, as well as field jackets and jeans). Michael says he uses [his company’s Clifford boots](https://www.drakes.com/usa/shoes/clifford-desert-boot-sand-suede)\n as his go-to travel shoes. “I don’t know if I should admit this, but even if I’m going away for business, I’ll take that pair and that’ll do me well across the board,” he says. “They don’t have a metal shank inside, which makes them easier to get across security, and the crepe soles are so comfortable to walk in.” \n\nDrake’s version is an upgrade from a standard desert boot you might see elsewhere. When they approached their manufacturer, they wanted to do a version of a desert boot that would work with both jeans and tailoring. So, they took the company’s regular design and reshaped the last, slimming up the front, narrowing the heel cup, and making the toe box softer and less bulbous. The insole was upgraded from a synthetic material to full leather, making the shoes more comfortable over time as a footbed forms. Finally, the interior was the sharpened up to give more ankle support, whereas the originals are a bit floppy. “A suede desert boot is a tremendously useful style,” says Michael. “If it’s not this for me, then it’s probably a loafer, but suede chukkas are where I’m at right now. You can wear them with casual suits, you can wear them to dinner, you can wear them on weekends. There are very few situations where they don’t look right.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d40f04b0f9be6a43c25fcde7f75803d3/tumblr_inline_pnkp94ynlV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c47352aef31cfce747e37f88df5d952/tumblr_inline_pnkpanaeG91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b00e0cdb42293567526b2705bcaedd19/tumblr_inline_pnkp9sZqOz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3201a4ebcc36ba598564bb2063edb3b4/tumblr_inline_pnkp8lzvrT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c8d2ea31e60e2bf61402d7c8893706f/tumblr_inline_pnkp8dx9vh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c203780150e4811af0b64e99f993b78c/tumblr_inline_pnkp8gdOAw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/124e06927fb1512feef5b169a2c41ef5/tumblr_inline_pnkp8uafeF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d61075c38dcf4e3e964e65c766c7c13/tumblr_inline_pnkpasggdK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4e0037337fd9ca45a55e737ec51c5192/tumblr_inline_pnkpe5D64u1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/93bad3329994313e726ee5bc83c6efab/tumblr_inline_pnkpe9XnaP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/12de380160aa735e4b25a712c191448b/tumblr_inline_pnkpf9xmwi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1187f747e989d8903005a7a89da7ecd5/tumblr_inline_pnkpbaB0ZY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/053952663b61979d250c579f8ba5f78a/tumblr_inline_pnkpfdSvzz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c6f6b347dd27d62af4501358049b153/tumblr_inline_pnkpcrC1Sf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c16e52c4fc71001c7bf3c9ffb923f4ee/tumblr_inline_pnkpdmTA3b1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/27903e32f37109c7b5ed544728c06a7b/tumblr_inline_pnkpa4ehKG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ff3021ea4e3f6f9ad2603b77fd868ff/tumblr_inline_pnkpfh1MRP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f147f9233139ddeb85bf3fe555f53b9/tumblr_inline_pnkpedkveA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a13b6a0d9e33c8334df8249bef7760a/tumblr_inline_pnkpfkUGUI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c0611522367f5b876316277b77de4ca/tumblr_inline_pnkpfoYTwL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6656869b2301c17d057fbf80086a63aa/tumblr_inline_pnkqe4cEfI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07b31d452bc64b4ceab84a7b88c025be/tumblr_inline_pnkpehdoXf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/99da85eee3009cf6d2dbb46bc77772bc/tumblr_inline_pnkqdpOiRP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f11663e37c3d60b181e35e481836e8d/tumblr_inline_pnkpfwvJNk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9624bc8004454c68da2aa319c562feed/tumblr_inline_pnkpb372zF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5d31b3f18f37b74f66dbefb008fea9b/tumblr_inline_pnkqg1BWDE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6e96ae71b99099b1a9a69edbbe75102c/tumblr_inline_pnkpfyyULV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/364dc1f676dbc50625946ad70891333d/tumblr_inline_pnkpg1MyW51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2fdb06de7281184a594a4bdae1f29da0/tumblr_inline_pnkpcsJq5m1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3dd24764f628820963c9647c6315ffe/tumblr_inline_pnkpg41SMc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09cf69b5b32f2c64edec788168cb0d5a/tumblr_inline_pnndfhbFzH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d3c6a47c6e5d41caaceddb1b1ac96ab/tumblr_inline_pnkpb7Fx3o1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3681f4f1fc89a94e7bfab90f53bd5482/tumblr_inline_pnkpabadlt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e4e8b996f611011f7f1fa602564fbf1/tumblr_inline_pnkpcwt7Zy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d76298ae130b6d6f4b72a5b40af5af18/tumblr_inline_pnkqf7t22e1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d55aa837a36a98ffb524974d38174f20/tumblr_inline_pnkpgdphde1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/aaa0c1457fc4ac7f1ecb3ada49c27b6f/tumblr_inline_pnkpdp8rwy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c8a6b33c9175be6dfab7b0ea9fead1f3/tumblr_inline_pnkpczLJ7i1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fefa09f388abceed1184a53bf47ec43c/tumblr_inline_pnkphaQ8001qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f1b91a98b7faab6551d0b7fbb51835e9/tumblr_inline_pnkpd2kqgv1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/15a56ffc7f2b727b827cf97d4241b934/tumblr_inline_pnkp9dNtOQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c125f15811168c1e47ec9051fe73d0b/tumblr_inline_pnkphex4aj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2fa631c2dcd7c4ceb116dbdf4aee260f/tumblr_inline_pnkphcEoVr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5ad27ac9ea1485fc43f3fd39378a9af5/tumblr_inline_pnk

many men of my generation, who grew up in the 1980s and ‘90s, our first introduction to classic style was at a [Ralph Lauren store](https://rstyle.me/+wK_RmLHc3ZP4u_BWUXVI3A)\n. That’s where we fell in love with things such as sporting tweeds, chambray work shirts, and the chalky hand of ancient madder. Ralph Lauren didn’t invent these things, of course, but they presented them in a way that felt sexy. [Brooks Brothers](https://rstyle.me/ad/ig5zqvnjge)\n has been many things, but it has never been sexy. \n\nIn some ways, [Drake’s](https://www.drakes.com/usa/)\n is doing that for a younger generation, albeit at a much smaller scale. As the brand has expanded beyond just accessories, taking on tailoring and sportswear, it’s been able to present a fuller vision of how classic style can be worn today. These lookbooks have become incredibly popular in recent years, often getting posted on sites such as [Reddit’s Male Fashion Advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/)\n within minutes of their release. And much like how Ralph Lauren helped translate classic style for me, I think Drake’s is putting a new spin on the language. Instead of showing pinstripe suits in luxuriously paneled offices, with decor reminiscent of an expensive lawyer’s sanctum, they feature softer takes on classic menswear in more relatable environs. [Tweeds and duffle coats are shown being worn at university campuses](https://dieworkwear.com/post/178088997364/drakes-goes-collegiate)\n, [seersucker suits in Southern diners](https://dieworkwear.com/post/171209828819/drakes-takes-on-prep-for-spring)\n, and [brushed Shetlands on moss-covered, rocky shores](https://dieworkwear.com/post/165125558564/drakes-drops-new-fall-lookbook)\n. \n\nThis season, the team went to Lanzarote, one of the seven main Canary Islands located just off the coast of Morocco. It’s a short four-hour plane ride from London, making it a popular fly-and-flop destination for vacationing Brits (many retreat there for some much-needed winter warmth). But for Drake’s, the subtropical archipelago was also an excellent solution to a real problem. How do you shoot a spring/ summer lookbook in the middle of January, when it’s snowing in London? To show their collection in a warmer clime, they headed to the one place known as the “Island of Eternal Spring.” \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f25d606c789035982e9a8ce12310e7a0/tumblr_inline_pnkpg993ko1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nSome designers wipe the slate clean every season and start anew, but when I first interviewed [Drake’s Creative Director](https://www.styleforum.net/threads/q-a-with-michael-hill-of-drakes-conducted-by-derek-guy-of-styleforum-part-1-of-2.279785/)\n [Michael Hill seven years ago](https://www.styleforum.net/threads/q-a-with-michael-hill-of-drakes-part-2-of-2.281565/)\n, he described his work as a kind of evolutionary process. “If you look at our collections from season to season, our designs never move dramatically, but they do progress nicely and slowly,” he said. “When you go through the design process, you very naturally come up with fresh takes, either on things you found in the archive or things you’ve been developing with mills.” That means playing with a color scheme on an old David Evans pattern or coming up with a twist on last season’s yarns. \n\nThe company has stayed close to that design philosophy as they’ve grown into a fuller menswear label. This season still has soft-shouldered sport coats made in Italy – the mainline’s versions are all half-canvassed, the more affordable Easyday is totally deconstructed with just some light fusing. They also still do slim-straight legged, flat front chinos and trousers; shirts made in their own factory; and an admirable collection of knitwear. Everything just comes in new fabrics. \n\nI particularly like their tailoring this season, which goes beyond your usual linens and tropical wools (although, they have a [handsome, slubby linen sport coat too](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/natural-linen-jacket)\n). There’s a tonal [olive cotton seersucker suit](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/olive-cotton-seersucker-suit)\n, which is a fresher take on the milk-and-sugar classic, and a [navy glen check with some color variation in the yarns](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/blue-linen-glen-check-suit)\n. Patterned linens can sometimes be hard to wear because the lines can look so sharp, but this one is exceptional (it was also woven by Loro Piana). Being such casual fabrics, you could break these suits up into separates and wear the jackets alone with tan or gray trousers.  \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/81b3840b8c2de669abd83decc3a496f9/tumblr_inline_pnkpgiRMLh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/516d3be84b7720868655b88135a46540/tumblr_inline_pnnysaoFeC1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThere are also some springtime versions of cold-weather favorites. [This wool-silk-linen sport coat](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/brown-wool-linen-gun-check-jacket)\n has a pattern that’s reminiscent of a gun club tweed, but it’s made from a material that’s light and breathable enough for summer (Michael notes the added silk-and-linen mixture gives the fabric a uniquely dry hand). [The garment washed, beige needlecord suit](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/beige-washed-cotton-needlecord-suit)\n, meanwhile, looks promising for those cold and damp spring days. When [I talked to Sid Mashburn a few months ago](https://dieworkwear.com/post/180843604584/are-fashion-seasons-outdated)\n, he said he wears finer ribs well into summer. “Even if it’s still cold in April, I won’t want to wear those chunky, wide waled cords, I feel like I’m mentally done with them. But a baby waled, five-pocket cord? I wear those throughout the summer. I think I picked that up from Californians who used to wear those baby-waled OP shorts – you think it’s a fall fabric, but they made it work for California’s warm climate.”\n\nAs usual, there’s always something exciting in Drake’s accessories section. This season, they have [crinkly viscose-blend scarves](https://www.drakes.com/usa/latest/rust-crinkle-stripe-scarf)\n that can add a touch of texture to an outfit, [expressive rhombus motif ties](https://www.drakes.com/usa/latest/navy-rhombus-motif-silk-tie)\n that look like they came straight out of an issue of _Apparel Arts_, and [single stick umbrellas](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/crimson-brown-and-gold-broad-striped-large-umbrella)\n inspired by Drake’s rep stripe ties. Among their casual outerwear, you’ll find Drake’s version of a [walking jacket](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/yellow-cotton-walking-jacket)\n – a classic British design made for [walking in the fells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_in_the_United_Kingdom)\n – and an [equestrian-inspired stable coat](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/olive-cotton-canvas-stable-jacket)\n. The stable coat looks a bit flat in product photos, but it comes into its own in the image above. The best thing about that jacket? The inside has a long, ten-inch strap that secures itself to a larger interior pocket. “The detachable strap forms a loop, from which you can hang a sweater or a scarf,” Michael explains. “It’s good for those days when you might need to carry a scarf on days that transition from warm afternoons to cold nights, but you don’t want to have to carry it around all day.” \n\n**HOW TO DRESS FOR SPRING**\n\nLookbooks are rarely meant to be taken literally. More often than not, they’re intended to convey a designer’s inspiration or vision, helping to set the mood for a season, rather than trying to give actual outfit ideas. Drake’s, however, is unique in that their presentations ride the line between inspiration and instruction. To be sure, the looks are still somewhat aggressively styled. This season, for example, they tied colorful sweatshirts around their models’ waists and shoulders to give the outfits some verve. But if you read between the lines, you’ll find some practical suggestions for how to dress this spring. I went over five areas with Michael.\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/872b300a472260f6a28406721b3f3782/tumblr_inline_pnkp9oyfaE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**Incorporating Color**\n\nA good trick for spring is to brighten all of your usual colors. Navy turns to French blue, dark brown becomes dusty tan. But how do you incorporate more cheerful colors without turning into a Crayola box? Michael suggests using one bright color as an accent piece. “In our lookbook, we have one of the models wearing a bright, Kelly green tie with a washed out tan suit. I think the tie works in that case because it helps visually anchor everything, but it’s not something I would pair with a bright blue suit,” he says. “It’s like the high-low thing. If you’re wearing a bright color, tone it down everywhere else. Say if you’re interested in wearing a pink sweatshirt. Ask yourself what goes well with pink. Well, green. So try layering with a green piece of outerwear. It’s about balance.” \n\nThey’re not necessarily bright colors, but I like the [terrycloth hiking shirts](https://www.drakes.com/usa/catalogsearch/result/?q=TERRY)\n this season, which come in apple green and jam red (Michael tells me they were inspired by an old climbing shirt he has in his wardrobe). “Those would work with both casual tailoring or with jeans,” Michael notes. “Another good choice is a strongly striped shirt. Something in a [mid-blue](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/blue-and-white-awning-stripe-linen-spread-collar-shirt)\n or [grapefruit pink](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/orange-bengal-stripe-cotton-linen-point-collar-shirt)\n can be a way to incorporate more color into a wardrobe without making you feel like you’re stepping out of your comfort zone.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f9db08a687750dc81ed353c7c5f9740/tumblr_inline_pnkpdkycsk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0766c7749760b18a58967f1621f62d89/tumblr_inline_pnkpb53GpE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**The Field Shirt**\n\nSpring is full of opportunities to dress down tailoring. [These wheat-colored field shirts](https://www.drakes.com/usa/latest/tobacco-cotton-twill-two-pocket-work-shirt)\n remind me of the best days of Banana Republic, back when they were still a safari-themed outfitter and not just a generic mall brand. The shirts are casual enough for jeans and workwear, but they can also be used with suits and sport coats. “For our lookbook, we paired them with [a navy suit](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/navy-merino-wool-fresco-suit)\n and [olive seersucker](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/olive-cotton-seersucker-suit)\n,” says Michael. [This olive linen dress shirt](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/khaki-linen-spread-collar-shirt)\n could be used much in the same way (maybe not with an olive suit, but with similarly casual tailoring). \n\n**The Underrated Cotton Suit**\n\nLike most men, my spring/ summer tailoring mostly relies on tropical wools and linens – sometimes the rare bit of wool-silk-linen mix, if I can find something. Drake’s has some wonderfully unique options this season, including garment dyed and washed pieces that feel a bit more relaxed than what you can get through bespoke (since garment washing is only possible when you’re making things in large quantities). My two favorites this season are the [olive tonal seersucker](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/olive-cotton-seersucker-suit)\n and [wool-silk-linen sport coat](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/brown-wool-linen-gun-check-jacket)\n, but Michael says he’s [most excited about cotton](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/tan-cotton-twill-suit)\n. \n\n“I love cotton suits for all the same reasons some people hate them,” he says. “They’re stiff, they crumple, the color fades. They don’t look perfect, but I think that’s a good thing. I can picture my cotton suit sitting on the end of my rail at home now. The way the sleeves curl, it looks like my arms are in them, and the sleeves will probably stay like that even after the jacket has been cleaned. If you get one in a heavy drill cotton, the fabric almost moulds to your body. That’s the wonderful thing about cotton suits. They’re casual and age with you, much like a good pair of jeans.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5cdbe8e582aae1948c0ed1d4e41cced4/tumblr_inline_pnkpbjoLtr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n**Summer Whites  \n**\n\nWhite is often considered a neutral base when it’s worn through shirts and sneakers, but put the color on legs and guys get uneasy. “We don’t think guys should be scared of white pants,” says Michael. “Particularly with white jeans or five-pocket cords, they can be a jumping off place for a lot of things. The advantage of white over classic blue jeans is that they’re easier to dress up. In fact, if you just substitute indigo jeans with white, suddenly an outfit can look a bit smarter. And they work in almost any situation where you’d wear blue jeans – they go with olive, navy, and stone colored jackets.”\n\nPerhaps the best thing about white jeans is that they’re an easy way to dress down a sport coat. Guys often try to dress down tailoring with denim – sometimes successfully, sometimes less so (I think the combo only works with certain cuts and materials). In the fall and winter months, this is easiest with tweeds and blue denim, but for summer, white jeans can be a more natural choice for [pure linen](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/brown-linen-glen-check-jacket)\n and [wool-silk-linen mixes](https://www.drakes.com/usa/new-in/brown-wool-linen-gun-check-jacket)\n. “They work with desert boots, penny loafers, and classic sneakers,” says Michael. “It’s one of those things where, if a guy just wears a pair for a few days, I think you get over that mental hurdle.” \n\n**The Useful Suede Chukka**\n\nNo shoe will do everything, but Drake’s makes a strong case for suede chukkas. In their lookbook, you can see how they style them with casual suits, blue blazers, and game jackets ([I have a similar pair from Alden](https://bit.ly/2TnD4yh)\n, which I often wear with sport coats and tailored trousers, as well as field jackets and jeans). Michael says he uses [his company’s Clifford boots](https://www.drakes.com/usa/shoes/clifford-desert-boot-sand-suede)\n as his go-to travel shoes. “I don’t know if I should admit this, but even if I’m going away for business, I’ll take that pair and that’ll do me well across the board,” he says. “They don’t have a metal shank inside, which makes them easier to get across security, and the crepe soles are so comfortable to walk in.” \n\nDrake’s version is an upgrade from a standard desert boot you might see elsewhere. When they approached their manufacturer, they wanted to do a version of a desert boot that would work with both jeans and tailoring. So, they took the company’s regular design and reshaped the last, slimming up the front, narrowing the heel cup, and making the toe box softer and less bulbous. The insole was upgraded from a synthetic material to full leather, making the shoes more comfortable over time as a footbed forms. Finally, the interior was the sharpened up to give more ankle support, whereas the originals are a bit floppy. “A suede desert boot is a tremendously useful style,” says Michael. “If it’s not this for me, then it’s probably a loafer, but suede chukkas are where I’m at right now. You can wear them with casual suits, you can wear them to dinner, you can wear them on weekends. There are very few situations where they don’t look right.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d40f04b0f9be6a43c25fcde7f75803d3/tumblr_inline_pnkp94ynlV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c47352aef31cfce747e37f88df5d952/tumblr_inline_pnkpanaeG91qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b00e0cdb42293567526b2705bcaedd19/tumblr_inline_pnkp9sZqOz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3201a4ebcc36ba598564bb2063edb3b4/tumblr_inline_pnkp8lzvrT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c8d2ea31e60e2bf61402d7c8893706f/tumblr_inline_pnkp8dx9vh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c203780150e4811af0b64e99f993b78c/tumblr_inline_pnkp8gdOAw1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/124e06927fb1512feef5b169a2c41ef5/tumblr_inline_pnkp8uafeF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d61075c38dcf4e3e964e65c766c7c13/tumblr_inline_pnkpasggdK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4e0037337fd9ca45a55e737ec51c5192/tumblr_inline_pnkpe5D64u1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/93bad3329994313e726ee5bc83c6efab/tumblr_inline_pnkpe9XnaP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/12de380160aa735e4b25a712c191448b/tumblr_inline_pnkpf9xmwi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1187f747e989d8903005a7a89da7ecd5/tumblr_inline_pnkpbaB0ZY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/053952663b61979d250c579f8ba5f78a/tumblr_inline_pnkpfdSvzz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c6f6b347dd27d62af4501358049b153/tumblr_inline_pnkpcrC1Sf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c16e52c4fc71001c7bf3c9ffb923f4ee/tumblr_inline_pnkpdmTA3b1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/27903e32f37109c7b5ed544728c06a7b/tumblr_inline_pnkpa4ehKG1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ff3021ea4e3f6f9ad2603b77fd868ff/tumblr_inline_pnkpfh1MRP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f147f9233139ddeb85bf3fe555f53b9/tumblr_inline_pnkpedkveA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a13b6a0d9e33c8334df8249bef7760a/tumblr_inline_pnkpfkUGUI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c0611522367f5b876316277b77de4ca/tumblr_inline_pnkpfoYTwL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6656869b2301c17d057fbf80086a63aa/tumblr_inline_pnkqe4cEfI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07b31d452bc64b4ceab84a7b88c025be/tumblr_inline_pnkpehdoXf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/99da85eee3009cf6d2dbb46bc77772bc/tumblr_inline_pnkqdpOiRP1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f11663e37c3d60b181e35e481836e8d/tumblr_inline_pnkpfwvJNk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9624bc8004454c68da2aa319c562feed/tumblr_inline_pnkpb372zF1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5d31b3f18f37b74f66dbefb008fea9b/tumblr_inline_pnkqg1BWDE1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6e96ae71b99099b1a9a69edbbe75102c/tumblr_inline_pnkpfyyULV1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/364dc1f676dbc50625946ad70891333d/tumblr_inline_pnkpg1MyW51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2fdb06de7281184a594a4bdae1f29da0/tumblr_inline_pnkpcsJq5m1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3dd24764f628820963c9647c6315ffe/tumblr_inline_pnkpg41SMc1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09cf69b5b32f2c64edec788168cb0d5a/tumblr_inline_pnndfhbFzH1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d3c6a47c6e5d41caaceddb1b1ac96ab/tumblr_inline_pnkpb7Fx3o1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3681f4f1fc89a94e7bfab90f53bd5482/tumblr_inline_pnkpabadlt1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e4e8b996f611011f7f1fa602564fbf1/tumblr_inline_pnkpcwt7Zy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d76298ae130b6d6f4b72a5b40af5af18/tumblr_inline_pnkqf7t22e1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d55aa837a36a98ffb524974d38174f20/tumblr_inline_pnkpgdphde1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/aaa0c1457fc4ac7f1ecb3ada49c27b6f/tumblr_inline_pnkpdp8rwy1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c8a6b33c9175be6dfab7b0ea9fead1f3/tumblr_inline_pnkpczLJ7i1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fefa09f388abceed1184a53bf47ec43c/tumblr_inline_pnkphaQ8001qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f1b91a98b7faab6551d0b7fbb51835e9/tumblr_inline_pnkpd2kqgv1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/15a56ffc7f2b727b827cf97d4241b934/tumblr_inline_pnkp9dNtOQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c125f15811168c1e47ec9051fe73d0b/tumblr_inline_pnkphex4aj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2fa631c2dcd7c4ceb116dbdf4aee260f/tumblr_inline_pnkphcEoVr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5ad27ac9ea1485fc43f3fd39378a9af5/tumblr_inline_pnk

It’s no longer enough for a publication to just say it’s “for men.”\n\nThis is Will Welch’s challenge at _[GQ](https://gq.com)\n_. Welch was recently promoted to Editor-in-Chief at the magazine, replacing Jim Nelson, and while GQ isn’t losing money, it’s lost some cultural relevancy. To get readers to return, Welch promises to make _GQ_ to be about more than just telling men how to match pocket squares with ties. This month’s music-themed issue, for example, [covers Frank Ocean](https://www.gq.com/story/frank-ocean-cover-february-2019)\n and dives into [John Mayer’s Visvim-heavy wardrobe](https://www.gq.com/story/john-mayer-greatest-fits)\n. And when Welch headed Conde Nast’s smaller, but edgier, _GQ Style_ title, he featured the [romantically styled designer Haider Ackermann](https://www.gq.com/story/haider-ackermann-berluti-gq-style-fall-2018)\n, [cult-favorite streetwear label Noah](https://www.gq.com/story/awake-ny-union-noah-streetwear-future)\n, and [Gauthier Borsarello’s private Paris showroom](https://www.gq.com/story/gauthier-borsarello-paris-vintage-showroom)\n, which is full of vintage inspiration. With Welch now at the top of GQ’s masthead, we can expect something similar between the main magazine’s covers. \n\n“Instead of dictating what’s good and what’s bad from some sort of imaginary mountaintop, if we can be meaningfully participating in a community of people – helping to elevate and tell the stories of the people who we think are doing really exciting things – to me that is a higher calling than, ‘don’t wear those pants, wear these pants,’” Welch told _[Business of Fashion](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/gq-says-goodbye-to-the-suit)\n_. “If you try to be everything to everyone, you end up not being much of anything to anyone. So we’re making _GQ_ less a big tent and more the only place to go when you want a rich, intelligent, and transportive plunge into all the stylishness the world has to offer.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2a33e73ee7dabb1000d72b1a37b3c162/tumblr_inline_pm8duk9Ff51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d45a90ba06cb8727912a4494249a641/tumblr_inline_pm8duoPiul1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThis increasingly seems like the new world for men’s style. Readers today have a much more sophisticated understanding of fashion. They don’t need to be told how Goodyear welted shoes are made; they’re just as well-versed in Neapolitan tailoring as they are with Raf Simons. Similarly, whereas almost all menswear shops once cleanly slotted into discrete post-war categories – with one shop focusing on just Italian tailoring, another for workwear, and another still for designer brands – it’s possible to find all this stuff under one roof. The new world of men’s clothing is much messier, more nuanced, and culturally connected. \n\nSan Francisco’s [Unionmade](https://bit.ly/2DWbTSK)\n, for example, is a leading boutique for hard-to-find workwear, neo-heritage brands, and Japanese imports. Today, next to their chunky Alden brogues and indigo-dyed sashiko jackets, you can find widely cut contemporary robe coats from the likes of Camoshita and Studio Nicolson. [Blue in Green](https://bit.ly/2GrC5GF)\n mixes technical outdoor gear with raw denim; [No Man Walks Alone](https://bit.ly/2N8xxVh)\n carries Neapolitan tailoring and the _avant garde_. When [Sid Mashburn](https://www.sidmashburn.com/)\n once asked me how I dress, I sheepishly answered that my closet has a bit of everything, from [Anderson & Sheppard](https://www.anderson-sheppard.co.uk/)\n to [Kapital](https://rstyle.me/n/dfnps9njge)\n to [Maison Margiela](https://rstyle.me/n/dfnptqnjge)\n. He laughed, saying: “sometimes people walk into my shop and ask how African beaded necklaces are supposed to go with brown hopsack sport coats. I say, ‘I don’t know, except they do in my heart.’” \n\nAnother one of these mix-it-up retailers is [Canoe Club](https://shopcanoeclub.com/)\n, which recently opened in Boulder, Colorado, at the base of the Rocky Mountains. “So many stores feel like they have to be pigeonholed,” says Canoe Club co-founder Timothy Grindle. “If it’s a workwear shop, it’s all Red Wing and raw denim. If it’s a fashion store, it’s all fashion. If it’s streetwear, it’s all streetwear. But if you look at how people actually dress, a guy can be wearing a pair of Nikes with a raw denim jacket and some vintage cords. Some people really stay in one lane, but most people shop eclectically. I have some guys who come into the shop who are eager to learn and want something authentic. But I also have just as many who know all about Engineered Garments and Balenciaga. When I was growing up and getting into this stuff, people weren’t having those kinds of conversations.” \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3ea87921b825cd20ee6ffe8a7ef323f/tumblr_inline_pm8duu5f8j1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/06d615d0366dc55c526043cd84075b4d/tumblr_inline_pm8dvrf2HI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThis has allowed Canoe Club to become a much more eclectic heritage-styled retailer. Here, you can find the usual brands, such as [Filson](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/filson)\n, [Velva Sheen](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/velva-sheen)\n, and [Clarks](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/clarks)\n (all basic and unassailable, available in any similarly styled store). Next to those are the offbeat riffs on workwear that will draw in menswear enthusiasts, including labels such as [Kapital](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/kapital-clothing)\n, [Engineered Garments](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/engineered-garments)\n, [Orslow](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/orslow)\n, [Chimala](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/chimala)\n, and [Monitaly](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/monitaly)\n. Then Canoe Club throws in some more fashion forward pieces, such as [Needles velour track jackets](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/needles/products/needles-rib-collar-track-jacket-brown)\n, [FEIT sneakers](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/feit)\n, and [elfish RFW pull-on boots](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/rfw-shoes-boots-footwear/products/rfw-swifty-leather-brown)\n. The store has a very tightly edited look, even if it’s hard to describe. “We like things that have some tie to classic menswear, but they don’t have to be strictly classic,” Grindle explains. “When I look around, I think the pieces look cohesive, even if the brands are all over the place. I like to be able to identify reference points in a piece.”\n\nCanoe Club seems perfect for its location in Boulder, a place that can appreciate mountain-styled workwear, raw denim, and outdoor clothing, but also has the sort of booming tech economy where people may be interested in rare and designer pieces. There are enough things here to suit conservative tastes. A guy could wear [Orslow’s slim-tapered 107 jeans](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/orslow/products/orslow-ivy-fit-denim-107-one-wash)\n with [Fortela’s bridge coat](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/fortela/products/fortela-pea-coat-blue)\n and [Howlin’s Icelandic sweaters](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/howlin/products/howlin-before-the-snowfall-combi-b)\n. Or he could try more adventurous pieces, such as [Monitaly’s faux-fur mountain parka](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/monitaly/products/monitaly-fur-coat-kodiak-fur-brown)\n, [patched-up RRL cord](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/rrl-double-rl/products/rrl-harrington-pant-grey-knight-denim)\ns, and the [hodgepodge of vintage finds](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/canoe-club-vintage)\n. One of the nice things about Canoe Club’s direction is that, no matter the item, there’s always some classic reference that helps anchor a garment to something more familiar. \n\n“That’s one of the reasons why do vintage here. If I have a mid-century original, say a Type I or Type II, I can point to that piece and tell a story. People will remember that jacket from their childhood or something, and then I can show how certain details evolved for another piece we have in a store. We also put the vintage stuff online because we like reward customers who like to dig deep into things. All the stuff comes from vintage dealers we’ve become friends with over the years.” \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab4330e5c5885f6ccaeaa3b13518a85d/tumblr_inline_pm8dujGC4D1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/359728dc3aac25eb58c06ccdd1a2cb53/tumblr_inline_pm8dwhXeNN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nFor a store that opened just two years ago, Canoe Club is a surprisingly large operation (although, they just have a six-person team). Along with their brick-and-mortar, they have a brisk online business. Their online chat system allows you to directly speak to a sales associate as though you were on the shop floor. The also drop [several lookbooks per season](https://shopcanoeclub.com/blogs/the-back-story)\n (Timothy’s wife Abby does all the photography) and maintain an [affiliate thread at StyleForum](https://www.styleforum.net/threads/canoe-club-official-affiliate-thread.641486/)\n. The store boasts an impressively large rooster of brands, many of which are highly selective about who gets accounts. “Being located in Boulder has helped with some of that because there aren’t other competing retailers carrying that brand,” says Grindle. “I don’t think it would be the same if we were in New York City.” \n\nSome of this scaling can be chalked up to Canoe Club co-founder Bob Lamey’s business experience. Before started Canoe Club, Lamey founded and ran the very successful [Shopbop](https://rstyle.me/n/dfnp3enjge)\n (now owned by Amazon and the womenswear sister site to [menswear’s East Dane](https://rstyle.me/n/dfnp3snjge)\n). Bob and his wife originally wanted to save the name Canoe Club for a passion project – probably a diner somewhere out in Wisconsin – but decided to use it for their new clothing store. Some of the other people working on the site, such as Sarah Halvorson (co-founder and Chief Operations Officer), are also Shopbop alums.  \n\nFor a store that’s clearly run by people familiar with analytics, Canoe Club is surprisingly reliant on a shoot-from-the-hip buying process. Grindle explains how he and Bob buy for each season:\n\n> A lot of this is about going with your gut and building relationships. When Bob and I are buying for a season, we’ll just put things on a rack and ask if they go together. There are some boring logistics, like making sure you have enough sweaters for winter, but it’s a very visceral thing. Bob has a strong sense of aesthetics and knows when he loves something. I also try to keep certain customers in mind when buying, which is why I love working the shop’s floor. I want to see people’s reactions. I want to know the guy I’m buying for. At the end of the season, we’ll drill down on our sell-through reports and adjust things – it’s always about hedging bets – but I also think you know when a store is doing math and science. For us, it’s about a gut feeling. Customers respond to things you genuinely care about. \n\nAs a sneak peek, Grindle tells me they’ll be getting in some really good pieces this season from Engineered Garments, New Balance (tier one), and Levi’s Vintage Clothing (“the LVC collection is kitschy and fun. It’s the space race seen from a mid-century Huntsville, Alabama”). They’re also getting in a special collection of re-releases from Ralph Lauren’s archive. And for this coming autumn, they’re picking up Visvim, Hender Scheme, Manastash, Yashiki, and Nanamica. It’s hard to pinpoint the exact theme that runs through Canoe Club’s rooster, but it somehow reflects the messiness of the market today. Most guys aren’t interested in just one thing; they’re open to experimentation (also, _[issa vibe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU3p6mz-uxU)\n_). “The target market is people who care about cool clothes,” chuckles Grindle. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/28db5bea2d45f19a882fb37a50f3f407/tumblr_inline_pm8dyrycv21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb552c2cff05321d0460ad8d1c359b23/tumblr_inline_pm8dvkterz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8eaf862b9ad00a0e17c8a0ac91b6f20f/tumblr_inline_pm8dwhLWOh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9986bb7daa04407c61176b51cb43f442/tumblr_inline_pm8e05RBn61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/13ed1087a02a8f3b571b8e819a069ffb/tumblr_inline_pm8dvlAXDU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb01762acb7fc6555f0171350e82cba0/tumblr_inline_pm8dvoJmRv1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/14c21cab5eba5d002488bc4b80cee59a/tumblr_inline_pm8dx6MpIi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3f4cd4da59287183a2ef8892714db3a/tumblr_inline_pm8dx8Ta041qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/65527feda25aebd6d949ff0a04eb37eb/tumblr_inline_pm8dzj2VpK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fa94f3041bae9eeb1825ec9534c5632f/tumblr_inline_pm9hyxPSaU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5471698aa8187c4edcb43cd09d54fcca/tumblr_inline_pm9hxlGNZm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/89ee8abccf3d00155d912e5fe349a580/tumblr_inline_pm9hxrBTxl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3588ccd7b5276576348d409209cfe83e/tumblr_inline_pm9i9xdkFa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/77e6afd5d963043c6f2b914a32bcc427/tumblr_inline_pm9hx8FPQr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba41bb47b40482d6c2ec0dca73c25a91/tumblr_inline_pm9hyvm2Pj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c04289015d13da712b4c480061d851b0/tumblr_inline_pm9iypNQgu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40cab75f0f29ab2fd4c35241d304164b/tumblr_inline_pm9ii8JaNl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4798a033586a8ee18efe59625603871b/tumblr_inline_pm9hyxHQKk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6889f5e542619cd90e238dfabb263558/tumblr_inline_pm9hyzH9NT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8944dc3e2eb0a41bcec7fddb32c5e45a/tumblr_inline_pm9inmS9VY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fa71e0b205265cfc6aee698cf68ee17e/tumblr_inline_pm9hyw6Gds1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07555b36f884facbb19b27c32747bc5f/tumblr_inline_pm9ii9fRUr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/00e4bb4980cda9fd0066e31ebdb9376a/tumblr_inline_pm9hxfsWmD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e7f4a897694ee8267cb51bb1995479b/tumblr_inline_pm9isvGMZb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9a21fd11ae6e1a4c3252b6acf44951e/tumblr_inline_pm9iswnOKA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ca4ac48c02917706f32dfaf897625e15/tumblr_inline_pm9i4g67c11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eba1d99bf59a6e16560cd680eaf3dc85/tumblr_inline_pm9i2kWJda1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd37c872b2a4e3c19a3d29525574cfa4/tumblr_inline_pm9ist4yJS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/14413ae831a5d7233dc4bc297c3605e1/tumblr_inline_pm9isu7oQL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0eca8309a5a4cf3d1bf92ec24ec636ee/tumblr_inline_pm9i2mwvDL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d12e3a151d5659da7d0d24693962dd6/tumblr_inline_pm9i5hvZ8Q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c612e5733ebd6351b16d4c634a842c8c/tumblr_inline_pm9i9ubSFz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/edba1769bc5590b1050d90e0175e889d/tumblr_inline_pm9ii7OS3Y1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/57c01315bf80397e8a8b8ede18eb2ea2/tumblr_inline_pm9i8m6Gru1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/059baebb077ced93779e998e1389ce05/tumblr_inline_pm9i9vz7si1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8f06c0a720c5fcec248c12deabdd062/tumblr_inline_pm9i9vz7ab1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/63b5b40c18eea84bf6ab023950990a4b/tumblr_inline_pm9ii41ntl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1c84e51708f1b1095ce99b7a901e0c35/tumblr_inline_pm9ii6bZpQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f59fe59c94597af7848506b2ab9fc2d2/tumblr_inline_pm9inlf0PU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/647bd1254a0c98b84a1f94c1cc85acd1/tumblr_inline_pm9innfUZf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b5de8daa370db81b1b8f6441d95a87c6/tumblr_inline_pm9inl9eKm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/74f7ce8ade09b101d5acf1cd9a837654/tumblr_inline_pm9iym3i5n1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d961c55b81a5ec4a709163bad70b404/tumblr_inline_pm9iyrMDBj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2bd5825de6204fbafe96bbf236b2a728/tumblr_inline_p

much of the 20th century, men’s media was about general interest publications giving readers the information they needed for “right living.” They told men how to dress for the office, grill meat on weekends, and mix delicious cocktails for after-dinner parties. As Cathy Horyn once wrote, “almost no one cares about this sort of thing anymore.” Online, audiences can easily find communities that share their specific interests and advertisers can target people more closely than ever before. It’s no longer enough for a publication to just say it’s “for men.”\n\nThis is Will Welch’s challenge at _[GQ](https://gq.com)\n_. Welch was recently promoted to Editor-in-Chief at the magazine, replacing Jim Nelson, and while GQ isn’t losing money, it’s lost some cultural relevancy. To get readers to return, Welch promises to make _GQ_ to be about more than just telling men how to match pocket squares with ties. This month’s music-themed issue, for example, [covers Frank Ocean](https://www.gq.com/story/frank-ocean-cover-february-2019)\n and dives into [John Mayer’s Visvim-heavy wardrobe](https://www.gq.com/story/john-mayer-greatest-fits)\n. And when Welch headed Conde Nast’s smaller, but edgier, _GQ Style_ title, he featured the [romantically styled designer Haider Ackermann](https://www.gq.com/story/haider-ackermann-berluti-gq-style-fall-2018)\n, [cult-favorite streetwear label Noah](https://www.gq.com/story/awake-ny-union-noah-streetwear-future)\n, and [Gauthier Borsarello’s private Paris showroom](https://www.gq.com/story/gauthier-borsarello-paris-vintage-showroom)\n, which is full of vintage inspiration. With Welch now at the top of GQ’s masthead, we can expect something similar between the main magazine’s covers. \n\n“Instead of dictating what’s good and what’s bad from some sort of imaginary mountaintop, if we can be meaningfully participating in a community of people – helping to elevate and tell the stories of the people who we think are doing really exciting things – to me that is a higher calling than, ‘don’t wear those pants, wear these pants,’” Welch told _[Business of Fashion](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/gq-says-goodbye-to-the-suit)\n_. “If you try to be everything to everyone, you end up not being much of anything to anyone. So we’re making _GQ_ less a big tent and more the only place to go when you want a rich, intelligent, and transportive plunge into all the stylishness the world has to offer.”\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2a33e73ee7dabb1000d72b1a37b3c162/tumblr_inline_pm8duk9Ff51qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d45a90ba06cb8727912a4494249a641/tumblr_inline_pm8duoPiul1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThis increasingly seems like the new world for men’s style. Readers today have a much more sophisticated understanding of fashion. They don’t need to be told how Goodyear welted shoes are made; they’re just as well-versed in Neapolitan tailoring as they are with Raf Simons. Similarly, whereas almost all menswear shops once cleanly slotted into discrete post-war categories – with one shop focusing on just Italian tailoring, another for workwear, and another still for designer brands – it’s possible to find all this stuff under one roof. The new world of men’s clothing is much messier, more nuanced, and culturally connected. \n\nSan Francisco’s [Unionmade](https://bit.ly/2DWbTSK)\n, for example, is a leading boutique for hard-to-find workwear, neo-heritage brands, and Japanese imports. Today, next to their chunky Alden brogues and indigo-dyed sashiko jackets, you can find widely cut contemporary robe coats from the likes of Camoshita and Studio Nicolson. [Blue in Green](https://bit.ly/2GrC5GF)\n mixes technical outdoor gear with raw denim; [No Man Walks Alone](https://bit.ly/2N8xxVh)\n carries Neapolitan tailoring and the _avant garde_. When [Sid Mashburn](https://www.sidmashburn.com/)\n once asked me how I dress, I sheepishly answered that my closet has a bit of everything, from [Anderson & Sheppard](https://www.anderson-sheppard.co.uk/)\n to [Kapital](https://rstyle.me/n/dfnps9njge)\n to [Maison Margiela](https://rstyle.me/n/dfnptqnjge)\n. He laughed, saying: “sometimes people walk into my shop and ask how African beaded necklaces are supposed to go with brown hopsack sport coats. I say, ‘I don’t know, except they do in my heart.’” \n\nAnother one of these mix-it-up retailers is [Canoe Club](https://shopcanoeclub.com/)\n, which recently opened in Boulder, Colorado, at the base of the Rocky Mountains. “So many stores feel like they have to be pigeonholed,” says Canoe Club co-founder Timothy Grindle. “If it’s a workwear shop, it’s all Red Wing and raw denim. If it’s a fashion store, it’s all fashion. If it’s streetwear, it’s all streetwear. But if you look at how people actually dress, a guy can be wearing a pair of Nikes with a raw denim jacket and some vintage cords. Some people really stay in one lane, but most people shop eclectically. I have some guys who come into the shop who are eager to learn and want something authentic. But I also have just as many who know all about Engineered Garments and Balenciaga. When I was growing up and getting into this stuff, people weren’t having those kinds of conversations.” \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3ea87921b825cd20ee6ffe8a7ef323f/tumblr_inline_pm8duu5f8j1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/06d615d0366dc55c526043cd84075b4d/tumblr_inline_pm8dvrf2HI1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nThis has allowed Canoe Club to become a much more eclectic heritage-styled retailer. Here, you can find the usual brands, such as [Filson](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/filson)\n, [Velva Sheen](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/velva-sheen)\n, and [Clarks](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/clarks)\n (all basic and unassailable, available in any similarly styled store). Next to those are the offbeat riffs on workwear that will draw in menswear enthusiasts, including labels such as [Kapital](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/kapital-clothing)\n, [Engineered Garments](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/engineered-garments)\n, [Orslow](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/orslow)\n, [Chimala](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/chimala)\n, and [Monitaly](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/monitaly)\n. Then Canoe Club throws in some more fashion forward pieces, such as [Needles velour track jackets](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/needles/products/needles-rib-collar-track-jacket-brown)\n, [FEIT sneakers](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/feit)\n, and [elfish RFW pull-on boots](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/rfw-shoes-boots-footwear/products/rfw-swifty-leather-brown)\n. The store has a very tightly edited look, even if it’s hard to describe. “We like things that have some tie to classic menswear, but they don’t have to be strictly classic,” Grindle explains. “When I look around, I think the pieces look cohesive, even if the brands are all over the place. I like to be able to identify reference points in a piece.”\n\nCanoe Club seems perfect for its location in Boulder, a place that can appreciate mountain-styled workwear, raw denim, and outdoor clothing, but also has the sort of booming tech economy where people may be interested in rare and designer pieces. There are enough things here to suit conservative tastes. A guy could wear [Orslow’s slim-tapered 107 jeans](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/orslow/products/orslow-ivy-fit-denim-107-one-wash)\n with [Fortela’s bridge coat](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/fortela/products/fortela-pea-coat-blue)\n and [Howlin’s Icelandic sweaters](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/howlin/products/howlin-before-the-snowfall-combi-b)\n. Or he could try more adventurous pieces, such as [Monitaly’s faux-fur mountain parka](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/monitaly/products/monitaly-fur-coat-kodiak-fur-brown)\n, [patched-up RRL cord](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/rrl-double-rl/products/rrl-harrington-pant-grey-knight-denim)\ns, and the [hodgepodge of vintage finds](https://shopcanoeclub.com/collections/canoe-club-vintage)\n. One of the nice things about Canoe Club’s direction is that, no matter the item, there’s always some classic reference that helps anchor a garment to something more familiar. \n\n“That’s one of the reasons why do vintage here. If I have a mid-century original, say a Type I or Type II, I can point to that piece and tell a story. People will remember that jacket from their childhood or something, and then I can show how certain details evolved for another piece we have in a store. We also put the vintage stuff online because we like reward customers who like to dig deep into things. All the stuff comes from vintage dealers we’ve become friends with over the years.” \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab4330e5c5885f6ccaeaa3b13518a85d/tumblr_inline_pm8dujGC4D1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/359728dc3aac25eb58c06ccdd1a2cb53/tumblr_inline_pm8dwhXeNN1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\nFor a store that opened just two years ago, Canoe Club is a surprisingly large operation (although, they just have a six-person team).

Before started Canoe Club, Lamey founded and ran the very successful [Shopbop](https://rstyle.me/n/dfnp3enjge)\n (now owned by Amazon and the womenswear sister site to [menswear’s East Dane](https://rstyle.me/n/dfnp3snjge)\n).

There are some boring logistics, like making sure you have enough sweaters for winter, but it’s a very visceral thing. Bob has a strong sense of aesthetics and knows when he loves something. I also try to keep certain customers in mind when buying, which is why I love working the shop’s floor. I want to see people’s reactions. I want to know the guy I’m buying for. At the end of the season, we’ll drill down on our sell-through reports and adjust things – it’s always about hedging bets – but I also think you know when a store is doing math and science. For us, it’s about a gut feeling. Customers respond to things you genuinely care about. \n\nAs a sneak peek, Grindle tells me they’ll be getting in some really good pieces this season from Engineered Garments, New Balance (tier one), and Levi’s Vintage Clothing (“the LVC collection is kitschy and fun. It’s the space race seen from a mid-century Huntsville, Alabama”). They’re also getting in a special collection of re-releases from Ralph Lauren’s archive. And for this coming autumn, they’re picking up Visvim, Hender Scheme, Manastash, Yashiki, and Nanamica. It’s hard to pinpoint the exact theme that runs through Canoe Club’s rooster, but it somehow reflects the messiness of the market today. Most guys aren’t interested in just one thing; they’re open to experimentation (also, _[issa vibe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU3p6mz-uxU)\n_). “The target market is people who care about cool clothes,” chuckles Grindle. \n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/28db5bea2d45f19a882fb37a50f3f407/tumblr_inline_pm8dyrycv21qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb552c2cff05321d0460ad8d1c359b23/tumblr_inline_pm8dvkterz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8eaf862b9ad00a0e17c8a0ac91b6f20f/tumblr_inline_pm8dwhLWOh1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9986bb7daa04407c61176b51cb43f442/tumblr_inline_pm8e05RBn61qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/13ed1087a02a8f3b571b8e819a069ffb/tumblr_inline_pm8dvlAXDU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb01762acb7fc6555f0171350e82cba0/tumblr_inline_pm8dvoJmRv1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/14c21cab5eba5d002488bc4b80cee59a/tumblr_inline_pm8dx6MpIi1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3f4cd4da59287183a2ef8892714db3a/tumblr_inline_pm8dx8Ta041qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/65527feda25aebd6d949ff0a04eb37eb/tumblr_inline_pm8dzj2VpK1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fa94f3041bae9eeb1825ec9534c5632f/tumblr_inline_pm9hyxPSaU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5471698aa8187c4edcb43cd09d54fcca/tumblr_inline_pm9hxlGNZm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/89ee8abccf3d00155d912e5fe349a580/tumblr_inline_pm9hxrBTxl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3588ccd7b5276576348d409209cfe83e/tumblr_inline_pm9i9xdkFa1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/77e6afd5d963043c6f2b914a32bcc427/tumblr_inline_pm9hx8FPQr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba41bb47b40482d6c2ec0dca73c25a91/tumblr_inline_pm9hyvm2Pj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c04289015d13da712b4c480061d851b0/tumblr_inline_pm9iypNQgu1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40cab75f0f29ab2fd4c35241d304164b/tumblr_inline_pm9ii8JaNl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4798a033586a8ee18efe59625603871b/tumblr_inline_pm9hyxHQKk1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6889f5e542619cd90e238dfabb263558/tumblr_inline_pm9hyzH9NT1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8944dc3e2eb0a41bcec7fddb32c5e45a/tumblr_inline_pm9inmS9VY1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fa71e0b205265cfc6aee698cf68ee17e/tumblr_inline_pm9hyw6Gds1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07555b36f884facbb19b27c32747bc5f/tumblr_inline_pm9ii9fRUr1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/00e4bb4980cda9fd0066e31ebdb9376a/tumblr_inline_pm9hxfsWmD1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e7f4a897694ee8267cb51bb1995479b/tumblr_inline_pm9isvGMZb1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9a21fd11ae6e1a4c3252b6acf44951e/tumblr_inline_pm9iswnOKA1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ca4ac48c02917706f32dfaf897625e15/tumblr_inline_pm9i4g67c11qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eba1d99bf59a6e16560cd680eaf3dc85/tumblr_inline_pm9i2kWJda1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd37c872b2a4e3c19a3d29525574cfa4/tumblr_inline_pm9ist4yJS1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/14413ae831a5d7233dc4bc297c3605e1/tumblr_inline_pm9isu7oQL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0eca8309a5a4cf3d1bf92ec24ec636ee/tumblr_inline_pm9i2mwvDL1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d12e3a151d5659da7d0d24693962dd6/tumblr_inline_pm9i5hvZ8Q1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c612e5733ebd6351b16d4c634a842c8c/tumblr_inline_pm9i9ubSFz1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/edba1769bc5590b1050d90e0175e889d/tumblr_inline_pm9ii7OS3Y1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/57c01315bf80397e8a8b8ede18eb2ea2/tumblr_inline_pm9i8m6Gru1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/059baebb077ced93779e998e1389ce05/tumblr_inline_pm9i9vz7si1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8f06c0a720c5fcec248c12deabdd062/tumblr_inline_pm9i9vz7ab1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/63b5b40c18eea84bf6ab023950990a4b/tumblr_inline_pm9ii41ntl1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1c84e51708f1b1095ce99b7a901e0c35/tumblr_inline_pm9ii6bZpQ1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f59fe59c94597af7848506b2ab9fc2d2/tumblr_inline_pm9inlf0PU1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/647bd1254a0c98b84a1f94c1cc85acd1/tumblr_inline_pm9innfUZf1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b5de8daa370db81b1b8f6441d95a87c6/tumblr_inline_pm9inl9eKm1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/74f7ce8ade09b101d5acf1cd9a837654/tumblr_inline_pm9iym3i5n1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d961c55b81a5ec4a709163bad70b404/tumblr_inline_pm9iyrMDBj1qfex1b_540.jpg)\n\n![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2bd5825de6204fbafe96bbf236b2a728/tumblr_inline_p
